The Division also used the SLAMM results to look at where future nesting areas might be located and whether there was development nearby or if they could be protected.  SLAMM predicts a decrease of sandy areas with sea-level rise, but one conculsion is that Poplar Island restoration has resulted in an increase in terrapin sandy beach habitat. Thus, this shows that if the Division can stay out ahead of sea-level rise they might be able to restore or create terrapin habitat than will not be affected by sea-level rise.   	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	 Completed Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic Marlyland Natural Ecosystems Inland Habitats and Watersheds  Beaches Biota Marine Terrestrial Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Ecological and Biological	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	Terrapin Nesting Habitat and Sea-Level Rise	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Maryland Division of Wildlife and Heritage	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

As states revise their Wildlife Action Plans, the need to integrate climate change considerations drives the adoption of vulnerability assessments as critical components. To help meet this need for New York, we calculated the relative vulnerability of 119 of New York’s Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN) using NatureServe’s Climate Change Vulnerability Index (CCVI)...The primary factors that drove our assessments included genetic variation, phenological responses, natural and anthropogenic barriers to dispersal, and restriction to specific geological features. Vulnerability was only weakly associated with conservation status. Species at the southern edge of their range in New York might become extirpated from the state. Our results agreed broadly with those from Pennsylvania and West Virginia.  Additional species in need of assessment include plants, crayfish, cave obligates, and functional or habitat groups of species. Our assessment makes several key points: 1) aquatic and terrestrial habitat connectivity must be maintained and restored, 2) for some species, stressors other than climate change are more limiting to their viability; 3) for some species, climate change will likely result in their extirpation no matter what management actions are taken; and 4) long-term monitoring is vital to detecting changes in New York’s wildlife populations."\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Completed Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic New York Managed Ecosystems Natural Ecosystems Biota Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Plans, Assessments, Studies Vulnerability Assessment	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	Vulnerability of At-Risk Species to Climate Change in New York\r\n	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	New York Natural Heritage Program	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.natureserve.org/prodServices/climatechange/pdfs/ccvi_report_ny.pdf\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

The impacts of our changing climate are already affecting coastal communities. This report provides decision-relevant information on a regional scale to individual, municipal, regional, and state decision-makers.  The information compiled in the climate assessment provides the foundation for developing local adaptation plans to a changing climate and this project will disseminate this information to seacoast municipalities. Adaptation can help reduce the vulnerability of both natural and social systems to climate change and variability, and can assist with preparing for and coping with negative impacts. Adapting to a changing climate requires both data and information at a spatial and temporal scale that is relevant to decision making. The information compiled in this climate change assessment report, combined with the NHCAW training programs, will provide the foundation for developing local adaptation planning to a changing climate.\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Completed Regional Or State New England New Hampshire Climate Impacts on Water Resources Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Translation of Climate Science for Sector/Decision-Maker Use  Physical Atmospheric Coastal and Oceanic Terrestrial (Groundwater, Soil Moisture, surface water, glaciers and ice caps, land cover, biomass) Climate Society Interactions Plans, Assessments, Studies Impact Study Risk and Vulnerability	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	Climate Change in the Piscataqua/Great Bay Region: Past, Present, and Future	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	Provide decision-relevant information on a regional scale to individual, municipal, regional, and state decision-makers information to assist in adaptation efforts.

The Phase I Strategy is a key component of the Maryland Climate Action Plan, detailing the actions necessary to protect Maryland's future economic well-being, environmental heritage and public safety in the face of climate change and sea level rise. This report lays out the specific priority policy recommendations of the ARWG to address short-and long-term adaptation and response measures, planning and policy integration, education and outreach, performance measurement, and, where necessary, new legislation and/or modifications to existing laws. Implementation of the Strategy is currently underway.

Knowing this relationship will help predict when    flooding and splash-over events (such as beach erosion) might occur based on forecast water level (tide height) and wave height data. Working with the National Weather Service in Gray, Maine, NERACOOS and modelers in the Northeast region, a working prototype was developed using a water level model (NECOFS/FVCOM) and wave model (Wave Watch 3). This prototype is currently working for Hampton, New Hampshire and Scituate, Massachusetts locations. We hope to expand to other regions depending on need. For more information on how to read the nomogram, click here. This product could be used by emergency managers, coastal homeowners and other users with interest and concern about beach erosion from large-wave storms. During the Patriot's Day Storm, there were four high-tide cycles in which the water level was near or above flood stage and the waves were greater than 20' in height. This combination caused the tremendous amounts of coastal damage seen during the storm. The Coastal Flooding and Erosion Forecast System actually predicted days in advance of the Patriot's Day Storm that there was a high likelihood of this damage occurring. This capacity is extremely important to coastal property owners and emergency responders, resulting in dollars and lives saved. 	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Completed Regional Or State New England New Hampshire Public Health and Safety Emergency Management Infrastructure Climate Impacts on Water Resources Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Coastal and Oceanic Physical Forecasts and outlooks (monthly to annual, models)  Risk and Vulnerability	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	Coastal Flooding and Erosion Forecast\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	Develop a working prototype that demonstrates the empirical relationship exists between storm tide, waves and coastal flooding or splash-over damage to help predict when    flooding and splash-over events (such as beach erosion) might occur.	f	f	f	f	f	Piscataqua Region Estuary Partnership (PREP)	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	\N	f

The project included four major components: 1) a vulnerability assessment to identify potential areas impacted by sea level rise and develop inventories of resources at risk; 2) development of a framework for interagency strategic planning; 3) development of a strategic plan; and 4) public outreach and education to promote public awareness of sea level rise issues. The Plan summarizes the State’s recent research and planning efforts related to sea level rise; discusses the key findings from the vulnerability assessment and other planning analysis; identifies the major planning issues for Anne Arundel County as related to sea level rise; and recommends future actions to protect resources and minimize impacts.	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Completed Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic Marlyland Local/City  Public Health and Safety Infrastructure Energy Communication and Commerce Fresh Water Resources Storm Water Wastewater Water Supply Transportation Built Coast (e.g., engineered solutions for shoreline protection) Managed Ecosystems Natural Ecosystems Social and Cultural Resources Economic Resources Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Plans, Assessments, Studies Adaptation/Action Plan Risk and Vulnerability	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	Sea Level Rise Strategic Plan Anne Arundel County 	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Anne Arundel County, Office of Planning and Zoning 	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	http://www.dnr.state.md.us/CoastSmart/pdfs/AASLRStrategicPlan_final.pdf	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	\N	f

Sea level has risen approximately one foot in the last century and is expected to rise another 2 - 3 feet by the year 2100. Sea level rise impacts coastal areas by exacerbating coastal flooding, influencing shoreline erosion, and submerging tidal wetlands and other low-lying lands. Such impacts pose a significant threat to the steep cliffs, wetlands and marshes, tidal estuaries, and sandy beaches, and barrier islands that comprise Maryland's coastal environment. Recognizing the need to begin planning for sea level rise, a NOAA Coastal Management Fellow with Maryland's Coastal Program developed a Sea Level Rise Response Strategy for the State of Maryland. The strategy sets forth the policy and implementation framework for reducing the State's overall vulnerability to sea level rise in the coming years.	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Completed Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic Marlyland Natural Ecosystems Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Improve Scientific Understanding of the Climate System and Essential Climate Variables Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Translate Climate Science for the Public  Promote Public Climate Literacy Hindcasts (climatologies, models) Forecasts and outlooks (monthly to annual, models)  Plans, Assessments, Studies Adaptation/Action Plan Adaptation/Action Plan Risk and Vulnerability Engagement Management Guidance (i.e. structured decision making) Regulatory/ Policy Guidance	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	A Sea Level Rise Response Strategy for the State of Maryland	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Maryland Department of Natural Resources 	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.dnr.state.md.us/bay/czm/sea_level_rise.html	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

In addition, the Conservancy, in\r\ncollaboration with partners and the local community, set out to use this understanding to inform the identification of strategic actions that would enhance resilience and facilitate adaptation of this globally important and productive coastal area upon which local communities and wildlife depend. To accomplish the latter, the Conservancy hosted the Eastern Shore Climate Change Adaptation Strategies Workshop in August 2010.  Out of the workshop, participants agreed on five primary adaptation strategies for the Eastern Shore and identified opportunities to implement these strategies.  This product describes the five adatpation strategies: local adaptation planning, shoreline management plans, restoration and protection of natural systems, groundwater management, and education and outreach.	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Completed Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic Virginia Public Health and Safety Water Quality Infrastructure Fresh Water Resources Water Supply Built Coast (e.g., engineered solutions for shoreline protection) Managed Ecosystems Natural Ecosystems Biota Social and Cultural Resources Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Translation of Climate Science for Sector/Decision-Maker Use  Evaluation of Climate Change Tools and Data Provision of Guidance Documents Promote Public Climate Literacy Translate Climate Science for the Public  Improve Communication and Education Tools  Adaptation/Action Plan Plans, Assessments, Studies	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	The Eastern Shore of Virginia: Strategies for Adapting to Climate Change	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	The Nature Conservancy Virginia	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	http://conserveonline.org/workspaces/e-shore-va-cc-adaptation/documents/the-eastern-shore-of-virginia-strategies-for-0/view.html\r\n	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	\N	f

Robert Thieler, U.S. Geological Survey, rthieler@usgs.gov	f	f	f	f	2004	f	f	f	Abstract: A coastal vulnerability index (CVI) was used to map relative vulnerability of the coast to future sea-level rise within Assateague Island National Seashore in \r\nMaryland and Virginia. The CVI ranks the following in terms of their physical \r\ncontribution to sea-level rise-related coastal change: geomorphology, regional coastal slope, rate of relative sea-level rise, shoreline change rates, mean tidal range and mean wave height. Rankings for each variable were combined and an index value calculated for 1-minute grid cells covering the park. The CVI highlights those regions where the physical effects of sea-level rise might be the greatest. This approach combines the coastal system's susceptibility to change with its natural ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions, yielding a quantitative, although relative, measure of the park's natural vulnerability to the effects of sea-level rise.  The CVI provides an objective technique for evaluation and long-term planning by scientists and park managers. Assateague Island consists of stable and washover dominated portions of barrier beach backed by wetland and marsh. The areas within Assateague that are likely to be most vulnerable to sea-level rise are those with the highest occurrence of overwash and the highest rates of shoreline change.	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Completed Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic Virginia Natural Ecosystems Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Forecasts of Climate Conditions Forecasts of Climate Impacts  Translation of Climate Science for Sector/Decision-Maker Use  Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Physical Coastal and Oceanic Surface (Sea-surface temperature, sea level, salinity, ocean color, wave height) Projections (intra-annual to multi-decadal, including SLR and model down-scaling) Maps (Imagery, geo-referenced data) Plans, Assessments, Studies Risk and Vulnerability	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	Coastal Vulnerability Assessment of Assateague Island National Seashore to Sea-Level Rise \r\n	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	U.S. Geological Survey\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2004/1020/images/pdf/asis.pdf\r\n	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

These \r\nchallenges represent a spectrum of local and national needs for which NOAA can \r\ndevelop and deliver services, and provide information, that can help inform effective \r\nadaptation actions and other climate-sensitive decisions. The four societal challenges, as \r\ndefined in “A Climate Service in NOAA: Connecting Climate Science to Decision \r\nMaking – Vision and Strategic Framework,” are\r\n\r\n1. Climate Impacts on Water Resources\r\nProviding coordinated and authoritative information systems to guide water \r\nresource managers.\r\n2. Coasts and Climate Resilience\r\nUnderstanding physical processes driving sea-level rise and coastal inundation, \r\nand providing best available information to decision makers on sea-level change \r\nimpacts and adaptive management strategies.\r\n3. Sustainability of Marine Ecosystems\r\nImproving understanding of, and information about, the impacts of climate on \r\nocean physical, chemical, and biological properties critical to managing large \r\nmarine ecosystems.\r\n4. Changes in Extremes of Weather and Climate\r\nDeveloping and delivering information to prepare for and adapt to climate and \r\nweather extremes, including droughts, floods, heat waves, and cold snaps.\r\nThis needs assessment will focus on challenge 2 on the resilience of coasts to the impacts \r\nof sea-level change. The term sea-level change acknowledges that while global or \r\neustatic sea levels are rising, local levels, or relative sea levels in certain places, may be  rising or falling.\r\n\r\nThe results of the literature review on the challenge of coastal sea-level change, presented in this document, represent a snapshot of gaps in data, information, and services as captured in 55 documents, presentations, and publications. This synthesis of findings highlights the needs of coastal decision makers for resources that can assist them in making informed decisions about the risks and impacts of sea-level change. The results of this report are intended to provide NOAA with current information on the needs of coastal decision makers in order to guide its development of trainings, engagement efforts, decision-support tools, and applications.	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 National Natural Ecosystems Social and Cultural Resources Other Training and Capacity Building	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	Coastal Sea-Level Change Societal Challenge Needs Assessment Report	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	NOAA Sea Grant	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.floods.org/ace-files/documentlibrary/committees/Coastal/NOAA_Coastal_Sea_Level_Change_Societal_Challenge_Needs_Assessment_Report.pdf	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

The product of this working group—The Yale Framework—assists conservation planners in selecting the assessment and modeling strategies that are most relevant to their specific needs. Rather than supplanting existing techniques, the Yale Framework provides simplified and flexible advice on models and data, and presents a list of commonly used datasets that can be helpful to planners. The Framework also provides a structured menu of options that assist resource managers in determining the best possible approach to conservation, as opposed to offering a prescriptive approach to natural resource management. The Yale Mapping Framework has been built using the Data Basin platform. Data Basin makes it simple to find reliable data and make compelling visualizations. Planners can locate datasets, combine multiple layers together in a visualization session, and then share maps with their colleagues. With the Data Basin data and tools, planners have everything they need to make their assessments.\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Ongoing National Natural Ecosystems Biota Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Translation of Climate Science for Sector/Decision-Maker Use  Evaluation of Climate Change Tools and Data Training and Capacity Building Data Support tools (help using specific data products) Adaptation and Mitigation Guidance, including Best Practices Manuals, Toolkits, and Guides Viewers and Web-based Tools Monitoring tools (e.g. U.S. Drought Monitor) Visualization tools (web-based, mapping programs) Prioritization Tools Management Guidance (i.e. structured decision making)	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	The Yale Mapping Framework for Integrating Climate Adaptatin and Landscape Conservation Planning\r\n	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	t	f	Yale University, School of Forestry & Environmental Studies\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	http://www.databasin.org/yale\r\n	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

The ultimate goal of the project is to have definitive actions that result in coastal communities being more resilient to climate variability. In Maine this included a survey and focus groups of property owners, municipal officials, and recreationists to determine "barriers and benefits that coastal property owners and municipal officials face in taking action to prepare for impacts from coastal storms, flooding, and erosion." This report summarizes the results of this project and the surveys and focus groups.

The study evaluated potential lost real estate values in the Bayside portion of Portland, under different sea level rise, storm surge, and adaptation scenarios.

To generate future projections for Portland, Farmington, and Lewiston, simulated temperature and precipitation from four climate models were fitted to local, long-term weather observations.  Two future scenarios were used for estimated carbon emissions. For the  lower emissions scenario, conservation practices and development of renewable energy reduce emissions below those of today by 2100. In the higher \r\nemissions scenario, fossil fuels are assumed to remain a primary energy resource, and emissions grow four times the amount of today by 2100.  The scenarios describe climate in terms of temperature and precipitation for three future periods: the  near-term, 2010-2039, mid-century, 2040-2069, and end-of-century, 2070-2099. All changes are relative to a historical baseline, 1970-1999.

The updated plan includes new, updated, and reaffirmed goals, objectives, and management solutions to meet the environmental needs for Buzzards Bay and its surrounding watershed into the next decade. The original plan was approved by EPA in 1992.\r\n\r\nThe updated Buzzards Bay watershed management plan is meant to be a blueprint to continue to help guide municipalities and watershed partners in their ongoing efforts to protect and restore water quality and living resources in the bay and surrounding watershed. We believe the update of the Buzzards Bay CCMP is also an excellent opportunity for municipalities to advance local priorities, and to request new measures or support from the state and federal government. While the Buzzards Bay watershed plan is not a regulatory document, the contents of the updated plan will help guide state and federal grants, technical assistance, and policy changes that will affect Buzzards Bay communities for years to come. For these reasons, the review of the new plan warrants the attention of local officials and the public.	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Completed Regional Or State New England Massachusetts Public Health and Safety Infrastructure Managed Ecosystems Natural Ecosystems Social and Cultural Resources Economic Resources Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Changes in Extremes of Weather and Climate Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Plans, Assessments, Studies Completed	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	Buzzards Bay Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan (CCMP)\r\n	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Buzzards Bay National Estuary Program\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.buzzardsbay.org/newccmp-shorelines.htm\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

The objective of the project is to identify areas of the landscape where tidal marshes can migrate or expand under several SLR scenarios, and to provide that information to relevant public and private planning and conservation organizations.  Thus far the project is only addressing south coastal Maine, as that is the portion of the coast for which LiDAR data was available when we started.  We will eventually expand the project coast wide as LiDAR for the remainder of the coast has recently become available.  Our SLR simulation is a simple bathtub model and does not attempt to address any of the dynamic processes affecting the development of tidal marshes.  At this point we are not attempting to predict where marshes might be lost or where whole new systems might form, rather just where existing marshes might migrate or expand to.\r\n\r\nSteps in the project completed to date:\r\n\r\n- all tidal marshes greater than 5 acres excluding isolated fringing marsh have been mapped in GIS using ortho photography\r\n- ground truthing of LiDAR accuracy in and adjacent to marshes was completed across the range of the project\r\n- ground truthing of vegetation was completed in a subset of remotely mapped marshes across the range of the project\r\n- GIS simulations for 1 meter and 0.6 meters highest annual tide (HAT) of SLR that identify undeveloped areas of the landscape where existing marshes might migrate or expand to have also been completed (see attached map for sample of results).\r\n\r\nSteps remaining include analysis of the results, formatting the data for external use, and sharing the data with potential users.\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Ongoing Regional Or State New England Maine Natural Ecosystems Wetlands (e.g., saltwater, brackish, freshwater; tidal/non-tidal) Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Forecasts of Climate Conditions Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Projections (intra-annual to multi-decadal, including SLR and model down-scaling) Maps (Imagery, geo-referenced data)	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	Maine Sea-Level Rise Simulation	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	t	f	Maine Natural Areas Program and Maine Geological Service	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f

Much has been done related to these issues in terms of science synthesis, policy development, and outreach.  From this work, the need for a more detailed analysis of vulnerable assets, adaptation strategies and implementation techniques that can be applied in Rhode Island’s coastal communities was identified.  The key obstacle has been the lack of digital elevation data for coastal Rhode Island and the lack of availability of this information.   This project collected and synthesized the best available digital elevation data for coastal Rhode Island as of 2010, resulting in a series of map and data products that resource managers and decision makers can use to assess vulnerability to projected sea level rise. The high resolution topography and bathymetry data can be used for many other applications as well. This collaborative project included a participatory process to ensure that the products are suited for state and municipal agencies and resource managers in the state. In addition to statewide products, a pilot project was implemented with the Town of North Kingstown to demonstrate the use of these tools for local planning and action to address sea level rise and increased inundation expected in the future.  \r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Completed Regional Or State New England Rhode Island Infrastructure Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Assess Climate and its Impacts Risk Assessments Forecasts of Climate Conditions Social Impacts (Health and Public Security) Forecasts and outlooks (monthly to annual, models)  Physical Coastal and Oceanic Surface (Sea-surface temperature, sea level, salinity, ocean color, wave height) Depth and Elevation Data Risk and Vulnerability	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	Mapping Assets Vulnerable to Sea Level Rise North Kingstown, Rhode Island\r\n\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Rhode Island Sea Grant College Program; University of Rhode Island Environmental Data Center\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	t	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://seagrant.gso.uri.edu/z_downloads/coast/coast_lidar_method.pdf \r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

More recently, the Reserve entered into a 3‐year project with 4 additional reserves to conduct coordinated salt marsh monitoring at a national scale. This marsh monitoring component will set up Reserve marshes as long‐term reference sites that can be used to 1) evaluate how natural salt marshes are changing over time in response to the large‐scale effects of global climate change and sea‐level rise, and 2) evaluate the ecological changes at restoring marshes around Narragansett Bay as they recover from tidal restrictions. This program will enable scientists and managers to assess how these marshes are changing over time in response to climate change, restoration, and other natural and anthropogenic stressors.  \r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Ongoing Regional Or State New England Rhode Island Natural Ecosystems Wetlands (e.g., saltwater, brackish, freshwater; tidal/non-tidal) Assess Climate and its Impacts Experimental Impacts (single species and multi-species, physiology and ecology, monitoring	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	Narragansett Bay Research Reserve Sentiental Marsh Monitoring\r\n	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	t	f	Narragansett Bay National Estuartine Research Reserve\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	\N	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.nbnerr.org/Content/NBNERR_Monitoring_Plan_2011.pdf\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f

This study was part of a broader assessment of New Jersey’s coastal environmental resources conducted by the Walton Center for Remote Sensing & Spatial Analysis (CRSSA) of Rutgers University and the American Littoral Society.  This report expands on Cooper et al., 2005.  "The primary objectives of this work is to examine six specific issues related to coastal vulnerability and future adaptability: to map near shore development; to map the land use/land cover that is vulnerable to tidal surge inundation and flooding; to map the distance from coastal waters to the first developed obstruction (i.e. how far removed is existing development from the surging coastal waters); to map the degree of shoreline alteration due to coastal protection structures; to map where coastal beach and dune habitats are relatively undisturbed; and delineate those portions of our coastal wetland complex that are free to retreat inland as part of the natural landward migration process (i.e., where are coastal wetlands bordered by undeveloped vs. developed uplands).

CRSSA is responsible for the technical aspects, while JC NERR is responsible for the collaborative, evaluation/assessment and knowledge dissemination portions of the project.  In summary, the proposed project has three main outcomes: 1) serve as a demonstration project as to the feasibility and utility of enhanced GIS/LiDAR-based assessment of coastal infrastructure and habitat vulnerability to sea level rise; and 2) develop a suite internet-accessible geospatial and database visualization and analysis tools that will facilitate the dissemination of this information; and 3) promote enhanced preparedness and land use planning decisions in the face of continued sea level rise. The first step in this project is to conduct a needs assessment of our intended users to (1) identify their current level and source of information regarding sea level rise and climate change impacts to New Jersey’s bay and ocean front , (2) identify parameters that are most important to their decision-making (http://www.jcnerr.org/Needs%20Assessment%20Final%20report.pdf), (3) determine their level of comfort with online mapping and decision support tools (http://www.jcnerr.org/Usability%20Testing.final%20report.pdf), (4) determine the best structure for querying and interacting with the CV10 DSS, (5) determine what would enable or prevent them from using such a product. \r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Ongoing Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic New Jersey Infrastructure Managed Ecosystems Natural Ecosystems Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Risk Assessments Forecasts of Climate Conditions Forecasts of Climate Impacts  Coastal and Oceanic Surface (Sea-surface temperature, sea level, salinity, ocean color, wave height) Forecasts and outlooks (monthly to annual, models)  Projections (intra-annual to multi-decadal, including SLR and model down-scaling) Maps (Imagery, geo-referenced data) Risk and Vulnerability Viewers and Web-based Tools Visualization tools (web-based, mapping programs)	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	Place-based Decision Support System to Assess Vulnerability of New Jersey’s Coast to Sea Level Rise\r\n	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	t	f	Jacques Cousteau National Estuarine Research Reserve\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://ciceet.unh.edu/progressreports/2010/9_2010/lathrop09/index.html\r\n	f	f	t	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

THe CCVAP  is a GIS-based tool that was developed to help land use planners, hazard mitigation planners, emergency managers, and other local decision-makers to identify vulnerability to coastal hazards and sea-level rise at the community level.   The CCVAP oultines the needed steps to identify  vulnerable land areas under present and future inundation scenarios geospatially.  Using these inundation scenarios (0.5 meters, 1.0 meters, and 1.5 meters), coastal decision-makers  now have a greater ability determine the potential inundation threats to  built infrastructure, sensitive natural resources, and special needs populations.  The resilience asseessment is a facilitated questionnaire.  It is a non-regulatory tool that is meant to help local decision-makers collaboratively  identify planning, mitigation, and adaptation opportunities to reduce vulnerability to coastal storms and sea level rise, building  capacity for coastal community resilience.  It is provides a starting point for a dialogue among various decision-makers, helping to spawn creative thinking and collaboration on ways to become more resilient for existing and future generations.  The questionnaire highlights the importance of local plan integration and consistency with municipal building codes and ordinances, and it identifies the importance of localized hazard assessments and the need to link them to planning, outreach, mitigation, response, and recovery. The report also discusses the Coastal Vulnerability Index.	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Completed Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic New Jersey Infrastructure Managed Ecosystems Natural Ecosystems Biota Social and Cultural Resources Economic Resources Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Physical Coastal and Oceanic Surface (Sea-surface temperature, sea level, salinity, ocean color, wave height) Forecasts and outlooks (monthly to annual, models)  Projections (intra-annual to multi-decadal, including SLR and model down-scaling) Plans, Assessments, Studies Maps (Imagery, geo-referenced data) Risk and Vulnerability Viewers and Web-based Tools Visualization tools (web-based, mapping programs)	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	New Jersey Coastal Community Vulnerability and Resilience Assessment Pilot	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Office of Coastal Management, New Jersey Department of\r\nEnvironmental Protection\r\n\r\nGreenwich Township, Cumberland County, NJ	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.nj.gov/dep/cmp/docs/ccvap-greenwich.pdf\r\n	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

Most species were selected based on their status as Species\r\nof Greatest Conservation Need within the West Virginia Wildlife Conservation Action Plan.\r\nAmong the species identified in the state plan, priority was given to globally vulnerable or\r\nimperiled species identified by NatureServe (G1-G3), and selected species that are critically\r\nimperiled at the state level (S1). A small number of more common species were assessed. More\r\nthan half of the taxa assessed were scored as vulnerable to climate change. Amphibians were the\r\ntaxonomic group at highest risk, followed closely by fish, mollusks, and rare plants. Highly\r\nmobile taxonomic groups including birds and mammals appear to be somewhat less vulnerable,\r\nas are common and widespread habitat foundation plants. Obligate cave invertebrates are\r\npredicted to have strong resistance to climate change impacts.\r\nSpecies with high global Conservation Status Ranks (at risk throughout their range) are\r\nstatistically only slightly more vulnerable to climate change than globally abundant species.\r\nState-level Conservation Status Ranks and climate change vulnerability are more closely\r\ncorrelated, but scores for individual species still vary widely. In other words, rare species are not\r\nalways vulnerable to climate change, and common species are not necessarily resilient.\r\nSix of the twenty-three risk factors assessed were strongly correlated with vulnerability to\r\nclimate change across all taxonomic groups in the state. They are (a) natural barriers to\r\nmovement and dispersal, (b) anthropogenic barriers to movement and dispersal, (c) physiological\r\nthermal niche, (d) physiological hydrological niche, (e) genetic variation, and (f) modeled\r\nresponse.\r\nIn terms of the relative vulnerability of different geographies in the state, downscaled\r\nclimate models indicate that species in the northern part of the state may experience slightly\r\ngreater warming than those at the southern margin. Species dependent on moist habitats or\r\nephemeral streams and wetlands in the eastern and western portions of the state are likely to\r\nexperience greater drought stress than those in the higher-elevation Allegheny Mountains, but all\r\nhabitats are likely to face increased drought stress, especially during the summer and early fall.\r\nSpecies on the southern, or “trailing” edge of their global range are more likely to disappear from\r\nthe state. High elevation species restricted to the cool, moist summits and plateaus of Allegheny\r\nMountain region of the state are at increased risk because they have no possibility of migrating\r\nupward, and potential migration northward is blocked by significant low-elevation natural\r\nbarriers to the north.\r\nBased on the results of the assessment and review of current literature, management\r\nrecommendations were developed for consideration in the next revision of the West Virginia\r\nWildlife Conservation Action Plan. Key recommendations are to increase habitat connectivity;\r\nmanage for ecosystem function and habitat integrity; protect natural heritage resources; protect water quality and streamflow; aim for representation, resiliency, and redundancy; consider\r\ninnovative and unconventional strategies; reduce existing non-climate change ecosystem\r\nstressors; monitor, model, and adaptively manage; forge new partnerships; and mitigate.	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Completed Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Changes in Extremes of Weather and Climate Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic Central West Virginia Natural Ecosystems Biota Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Plans, Assessments, Studies Vulnerability Assessment	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment of Species of Concern in West Virginia. 	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	West Virginia Division of Natural Resources	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.wvdnr.gov/publications/PDFFiles/ClimateChangeVulnerability.pdf	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	\N	f

As climate changes over the coming century, these problems facing coastal communities will likely worsen. Good management and policy decision-making require baseline information on the rates, trends, and scientific understanding of the processes of coastal change on a regional to national scale. To address this need, the U.S. Geological Survey is engaged in a research project of national scope to measure, report, and interpret historical shoreline change along open-ocean coasts of the United States. One of the primary goals of this project is to understand shoreline change hazards using methods that are comparable from one area of the country to another and that will allow for future, repeatable analyses of shoreline movement, coastal erosion, and land loss.	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 National Natural Ecosystems Coasts Assess Climate and its Impacts Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Plans, Assessments, Studies Risk and Vulnerability Impact Study Risk and Vulnerability Problem Focused	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	USGS Science for the Nation’s Changing Coasts: \r\nShoreline Change Research Fact Sheet	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	USGS	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2011/3073/	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

The project synthesizes information on coastal environments and uncertainties in knowledge of coastal processes into a Bayesian statistical analysis framework. The Bayesian approach allows researchers to evaluate the probability of a number of sea-level rise impacts, and provides information that can be used for decision making.\r\nThe Bayesian statistical framework is ideal for using data sets derived from historical or modern observations such as long-term shoreline change or wetland accretion/elevation trends. This information can be combined with model simulations and used to define the relationships between key variables in coastal environments. A Bayesian Network provides a means of integrating these data to evaluate competing hypotheses regarding the relationships between forcing factors (e.g., rate of SLR, suspended sediment concentration, elevation change), and responses (e.g., shoreline change, wetland vertical accretion, water table change). This framework allows scientists to make probabilistic predictions of the future state of coastal environments for outcomes such as shoreline change, wetland survival, and changes in the depth to groundwater. The predictions also have estimates of outcome uncertainty that can be expressed as both numbers (e.g., 90%) and words (e.g., very likely). The ability to communicate SLR impacts in terms of a probabilistic prediction can improve scientists’ ability to support decision making and evaluate specific management questions about alternatives for addressing SLR. This information can also identify research needed to improve predictive skill.	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Completed National Natural Ecosystems Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Assess Climate and its Impacts Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Coastal and Oceanic Surface (Sea-surface temperature, sea level, salinity, ocean color, wave height) Physical Risk Assessment or Risk Management Climate Society Interactions Risk and Vulnerability Plans, Assessments, Studies Viewers and Web-based Tools Management Guidance (i.e. structured decision making) Training and Capacity Building Adaptation and Mitigation Guidance, including Best Practices Manuals, Toolkits, and Guides	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	Sea-level Rise Hazards and Decision Support	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	U.S. Geological Survey	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://wh.er.usgs.gov/slr/index.html	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

Trends for high flow quantiles are less clear, despite recent research\r\nshowing increased precipitation in the conterminous United States over the last century that has been brought\r\nabout primarily by an increased frequency and intensity of events in the upper 10th percentile of the daily precipitation\r\ndistribution – particularly in the Northeast. This study investigates trends in 28 long-term annual\r\nflood series for New England watersheds with dominantly natural streamflow. The flood series are an average of\r\n75 years in length and are continuous through 2006. Twenty-five series show upward trends via the nonparametric\r\nMann-Kendall test, 40% (10) of which are statistically significant (p < 0.1). Moreover, an average standardized\r\ndepartures series for 23 of the study gages indicates that increasing flood magnitudes in New England\r\noccurred as a step change around 1970. The timing of this is broadly synchronous with a phase change in the\r\nlow frequency variability of the North Atlantic Oscillation, a prominent upper atmospheric circulation pattern\r\nthat is known to effect climate variability along the United States east coast. Identifiable hydroclimatic shifts\r\nshould be considered when the affected flow records are used for flood frequency analyses. Special treatment of\r\nthe flood series can improve the analyses and provide better estimates of flood magnitudes and frequencies\r\nunder the prevailing hydroclimatic condition.	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Completed Regional Or State New England Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Climate Impacts on Water Resources Changes in Extremes of Weather and Climate Natural Ecosystems Assess Climate and its Impacts Forecasts of Climate Impacts  Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Plans, Assessments, Studies Impact Study	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	Evidence for Changing Flood Risk in New England Since the Late 20th Century	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	NOAA	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2008.00277.x/abstract	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

There are four modules that compose this framework. These modules walk the user through a systematic process for (1) categorizing a species’ baseline vulnerability to extinction or major population reduction, (2) categorizing a species’ vulnerability to future climate change, (3) developing a matrix that gives an overall score of the species’ vulnerability to non-climate and climate change stressors, and (4) qualitatively determining the uncertainty in the estimate of a species’ vulnerability. \r\n	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Completed National Biota Endangered, Threatened, or Protected Species Terrestrial Candidate Species Species of Concern Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Ecological and Biological Plans, Assessments, Studies Impact Study Risk and Vulnerability Problem Focused Training and Capacity Building Management Guidance (i.e. structured decision making) Regulatory/ Policy Guidance	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	A Framework for Categorizing the Relative Vulnerability of Threatened and Endangered Species to Climate Change 	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	EPA	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	 http://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/global/recordisplay.cfm?deid=203743	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

Annual peak discharges have increased over this period\r\non many New England rivers with dominantly natural streamﬂow – especially for smaller, more frequent ﬂoods.\r\nTo better investigate high-frequency ﬂoods (<5-year recurrence interval), we analyze the partial duration ﬂood\r\nseries for 23 New England rivers selected for minimal human impact. The study rivers have continuous records\r\nthrough 2006 and an average period of record of 71 years. Twenty-two of the 23 rivers show increasing trends\r\nin peaks over threshold per water year (POT⁄WY) – a direct measure of ﬂood frequency – using the MannKendall trend test. Ten of these trends had p < 0.1. Seventeen rivers show positive trends in ﬂood magnitude,\r\nsix of which had p < 0.1. We also investigate a potential hydroclimatic shift in the region around 1970.\r\nTwenty-two of the 23 rivers show increased POT⁄WY in the post-1970 period when comparing pre- and post-\r\n1970 records using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. More than half of these increases have p < 0.1, indicating a\r\nshift in ﬂow regime toward more frequent ﬂooding. Region wide, we found a median increase of one ﬂood per\r\nyear for the post-1970 period. Because frequent ﬂoods are important channel-forming ﬂows, these results have\r\nimplications for channel and ﬂoodplain morphology, aquatic habitat, and restoration.	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Completed Climate Impacts on Water Resources Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) National Regional Or State New England Natural Ecosystems Assess Climate and its Impacts Forecasts of Climate Impacts  Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Plans, Assessments, Studies Impact Study Changes in Extremes of Weather and Climate	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	Increased Frequency of Low-Magnitude Floods in New England	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	NOAA	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://instaar.colorado.edu/uploads/publications/armstrong_etal_2012_increased_frequency_of_low-magnitude_floods_in_new_england.pdf	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

Investigation of such impacts, specifically marsh depletion and increased mudflats at Bombay Hook, will be conducted to determine patterns of sediment flux in or out of the depleted marsh area. Data collection will involve conducting river transects within the Leipsic River using the Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) and associated software to collect and process tide and current data. Water quality will also be monitored, specifically total sediment solids (TSS) to aid in determining sediment fluxes in or out of the depleted marsh area.\r\n\r\nThis study will result in a written report that includes a summary of results; discussion of data analysis and statistical procedures. Results will be used to predict future changes in marsh depletion and to help determine marsh management techniques to counteract these impacts affecting the tidal \r\nmarshes at Bombay Hook.	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Completed Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic Delaware Natural Ecosystems Assess Climate and its Impacts Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Coastal and Oceanic Surface (Sea-surface temperature, sea level, salinity, ocean color, wave height) Sub-surface (e.g., temperature, salinity, nutrients, carbon, phytoplankton) Physical Surveys and PreliminaryAssessments	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	Bombay Hook Hydrology/ Sediment Movement Study 	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	DNREC Delaware Coastal Programs, US Fish and Wildlife Service	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.dnrec.delaware.gov/coastal/Documents/SeaLevelRise/SLRCompSept2011.pdf	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

The five MARCO states agreed to work together to develop a regional, web-based portal as part of their 2009 action plan. In response to this need, the Virginia Coastal Zone Management Program provided funding (through their CZM Award from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration- NOAA) for creation of this prototype mapping and planning portal for the Mid-Atlantic region. The portal was developed by a team of representatives from each of the Mid-Atlantic States, NOAA, and The Nature Conservancy.   The portal includes map data layers grouped into five broad categories:\r\nAdministrative (e.g. official boundaries)\r\nBiological (e.g. sea‐floor habitats)\r\nGeophysical (e.g. water depth, sediments)\r\nHuman Uses (e.g. fishing, shipping)\r\nDecision Support (e.g. overlays of various uses and natural features). The portal includes a sea-level rise vulnerability layer based on the coastal vulnerability index under the Geophysical category.	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	\N	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic New York New Jersey Marlyland Delaware Virginia District Of Columbia Infrastructure Energy Managed Ecosystems Fisheries Natural Ecosystems Biota Inland Habitats and Watersheds  Sustainability of Marine Ecosystems Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Changes in Extremes of Weather and Climate Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Assess Climate and its Impacts Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Ecological and Biological Vulnerability Assessment Risk and Vulnerability Plans, Assessments, Studies Viewers and Web-based Tools Visualization tools (web-based, mapping programs)	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	Mid-Atlantic Regional Council on the Ocean (MARCO) Portal\r\n	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	MARCO, Mid-Atlantic States, The Nature Conservancy (TNC)\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.midatlanticocean.org/map_portal.html	f	f	t	t	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

This approach focuses on the cost of damage from sea-level rise and storm surges. This approach uses GIS and incorporates various sources of existing data, including U.S. Army Corps depth-damage functions,  NOAA's  Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH), and other flood methods as well as sea-level rise scenarios, property values, and infrastructure costs. This tool is primarily meant for municipal planners.

Decreasing availability, declining quality, and growing demand for water are\r\ncreating significant challenges to businesses and investors who have traditionally taken clean,\r\nreliable and inexpensive water for granted. These problems are already causing decreases\r\nin companies’ water allotments, shifts toward full-cost water pricing, more stringent water\r\nquality regulations, growing community opposition, and increased public scrutiny of corporate\r\nwater practices.\r\nThis Ceres/Pacific Institute report concludes that climate change will exacerbate these water\r\nrisks, especially as the world population grows by 50 million a year.	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	 Completed Climate Impacts on Water Resources Regional Or State National International Public Health and Safety Infrastructure Fresh Water Resources	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	Water Scarcity and Climate Change: Growing Risks for Businesses and Investors	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	CERES, Pacific Institute	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.pacinst.org/reports/business_water_climate/full_report.pdf	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	\N	f

In short, the study found that even in the midst of the growing economic crisis, over 90 percent of Americans said that the United States should act to reduce global warming, including 34 percent who said the U.S. should make a large-scale effort, even if it has large economic costs.  	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 National Cross Disciplinary Climate Society Interactions Decision Making Communication and Education Other	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	Climate Change in the American Mind: Americans' Climate Change Beliefs, Attitudes, Policy Preferences, and Actions	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Yale University	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://environment.yale.edu/climate/files/CC_American_Mind.pdf	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)\r\n\r\nFourth Assessment Report, 1 Climate Change 2007: Synthesis Report, forecasts that climate change will have significant impacts on populations and environments around the world. Furthermore, it is likely that in the absence of concerted efforts to mitigate greenhouse emissions, climate change will have negative effects on business and global markets. It will likely lead to a change in existing business models and current risk management structures. \r\n\r\nThis publication is focused on providing an overview of adaptation from a business perspective. It describes potential impacts of climate changes, risks and opportunities for business, and why business should consider adaptation planning and measures. It summarizes intergovernmental efforts to promote adaptation in vulnerable regions and highlights areas in which business could have a role in promoting adaptation, both at community and global levels.\r\n	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	 Completed International National Regional Or State Recreation and Tourism Social and Cultural Resources Economic Resources Cross Disciplinary Biota Natural Ecosystems Managed Ecosystems Infrastructure Public Health and Safety	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	Adaptation: An Issue Brief for Business	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	World Business Council	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.preventionweb.net/files/7781_Adaptation1.pdf	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

Some of the differences are based on objective factors beyond anyone’s control: for\r\ninstance, the coldest states have high heating needs, while the hottest states use a lot of air conditioning. Other\r\ndifferences may be based on policies and measures that have lowered emissions in some states, and could be\r\nreplicated in others. Identifying the causes of interstate differences in emissions may also help clarify the\r\npotential regional impacts of policies, such as a cap and trade system, which put a price on carbon emissions.	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Completed Regional Or State New England Mid-Atlantic Central Great Lakes South East South Carolina North Carolina Ohio West Virginia District Of Columbia Virginia Delaware Marlyland Pennsylvania New Jersey New York Rhode Island Connecticut Vermont Massachusetts New Hampshire Maine Viewers and Web-based Tools Management Guidance (i.e. structured decision making) Regulatory/ Policy Guidance	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	t	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	Greenhouse Gases and the American Lifestyle: Understanding Interstate Differences in Emissions	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	t	f	t	f	\N	f	f	t	f	f	Ecotrust, Economics for Equity and the Environment, Stockholm Environment Institute Report	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	\N	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.e3network.org/papers/NRDC_state_emissions_report.pdf	f	t	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	\N	f

It focuses on climate change impacts in different regions of the U.S. and on various aspects of society and the economy such as energy, water, agriculture, and health. It’s also a report written in plain language, with the goal of better informing public and private decision making at all levels.\r\n\r\nIn addition to discussing the impacts of climate change in the U.S., the report also highlights the choices we face in response to human-induced climate change. It is clear that impacts in the United States are already occurring and are projected to increase in the future, particularly if the concentration of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere continues to rise. So, choices about how we manage greenhouse gas emissions will have far-reaching consequences for climate change impacts. Similarly, there are choices to be made about adaptation strategies that can help to reduce or avoid some of the undesirable impacts of climate change. This report provides many of the scientific underpinnings for effective decisions to be made – at the national and at the regional level. \r\n\r\n	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Completed National Public Health and Safety Infrastructure Energy Fresh Water Resources Communication and Commerce Transportation Built Coast (e.g., engineered solutions for shoreline protection) Managed Ecosystems Agriculture Natural Ecosystems Biota Social and Cultural Resources Recreation and Tourism Economic Resources Assess Climate and its Impacts Improve Scientific Understanding of the Climate System and Essential Climate Variables	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Global Change Research Progam	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	http://www.globalchange.gov/publications/reports/scientific-assessments/us-impacts	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

Real-Time Kinematic GPS was used to attain elevation data for S. alterniflora to determine the elevational growth range. LiDAR was used during project design to ensure a representative elevation range was sampled. The MVI classifies healthy, degrading, and severely degrading short-form Spartina alterniflora marsh regions .\r\n\r\nThe MVI will be essential for evaluating wetland vulnerability to sea-level rise on a watershed or statewide basis, while also enabling the strategic placement of monitoring resources to enhance efforts to understand the future evolution and migration potential of Delaware’s tidal wetlands, as well as promiting conservation and restoration. MVI classification optimizes the monitoring efforts and resources to the highest levels possible, so the broadest extent of Delaware’s tidal wetlands may be evaluated and managed.  The MVI also classifies healthy and degrading short-form Spartina alterniflora marshes based on a correlation between degrading marshes and low elevations. With success, the MVI can be used in Mid-Atlantic States for regional comparison and planning.	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Completed Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic Delaware Natural Ecosystems Wetlands (e.g., saltwater, brackish, freshwater; tidal/non-tidal) Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Coastal and Oceanic Surface (Sea-surface temperature, sea level, salinity, ocean color, wave height) Plans, Assessments, Studies Risk and Vulnerability	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	Delaware Tidal Marsh Vulnerability Index	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.dnrec.delaware.gov/Admin/DelawareWetlands/Documents/Conference%20presentations/Siok_Marsh%20Vulnerability%20Index%20(MVI)_DE%20Wetlands%20Conf%202010.pdf \r\n	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f

The goal of the Sea Level Rise Initiative is to reduce Delaware’s future vulnerability to the effects of sea level rise.  This will be accomplished by: providing scientific and technical support for decision-making, implementing on-the-ground project in partnership with stakeholders, providing educational and outreach opportunities for stakeholders and the public, improving existing policies and management practices and/or developing new policies and management practices where necessary.    \r\nThe Sea Level Rise Initiative is designed to be iterative and will grow and \r\nchange as new data, outreach and policy needs are identified.  Part of this initiative is developing a Sea-Level Rise Adaptation Plan. The Initiative website includes all relevant activities as does the 2011 Compendium.	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Ongoing Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic Delaware Public Health and Safety Infrastructure Managed Ecosystems Natural Ecosystems Biota Social and Cultural Resources Economic Resources Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Improve Scientific Understanding of the Climate System and Essential Climate Variables Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Promote Public Climate Literacy Coastal and Oceanic Climate Society Interactions Physical Coastal and Oceanic Surface (Sea-surface temperature, sea level, salinity, ocean color, wave height) Maps (Imagery, geo-referenced data) Projections (intra-annual to multi-decadal, including SLR and model down-scaling) Plans, Assessments, Studies Vulnerability Assessment Engagement Engagement	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	Delaware Sea-Level Rise Initiative	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	t	f	Delaware Coastal Management Program	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.dnrec.delaware.gov/coastal/Pages/SeaLevelRiseAdaptation.aspx\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

These maps reflect the filling of these watersheds at constant elevations also referred to as "Bath Tub" modeling. In other words, the maps show the water levels rising in the watersheds similar to the “filling of a bathtub”.   These maps  represent a constant,  watershed based,  water level and  do not include any changes in water level due to the distance from tidal forcing, downstream flow, or other factors  which could possibly change water levels.  There are various uses for these maps including: assessing and planning land use and zoning ordinances to protect community resources while guiding new development; developing emergency management plans to prepare for natural disasters like nor’easters or tropical storms; determining impacts to the economy such as changes to the business and tourism sectors; conserving wildlife, wetlands, beaches, and other natural resources; protecting recreational areas like fishing spots, boating areas, parks, and cultural heritage locations; developing future plans for infrastructure like roads, fire departments, schools, sewer systems, drinking water, etc.; managing agriculture practices to conserve working farm lands and protect irrigation sources; and planning for coastal community resiliency by determining hazards and vulnerabilities.	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Completed Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic Delaware Public Health and Safety Infrastructure Managed Ecosystems Natural Ecosystems Social and Cultural Resources Economic Resources Assess Climate and its Impacts Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Physical Coastal and Oceanic Surface (Sea-surface temperature, sea level, salinity, ocean color, wave height) Maps (Imagery, geo-referenced data) Projections (intra-annual to multi-decadal, including SLR and model down-scaling)	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	Delaware Sea-Level Rise Inundation Maps	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Delaware Coastal Programs	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.dnrec.delaware.gov/Pages/SLRMaps.aspx	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

This thermal factor (juvenile mortality during winter) was then combined with IPCC general circulation models to predict changes in species range under various climate scenarios.  Results indicate that gray snapper distribution will shift northward under all scenarios.  Authors indicate that refining these range predictions will involve addressing uncertainty associated with the thermal tolerance variable, and identify improvements of these types of biological parameters as a major research need.	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Completed Sustainability of Marine Ecosystems Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Regional Or State New England Mid-Atlantic Maine New Hampshire Massachusetts Rhode Island South East North Carolina South Carolina Marlyland New York Delaware Connecticut Virginia New Jersey Managed Ecosystems Fisheries Natural Ecosystems Oceans Assess Climate and its Impacts Forecasts of Climate Impacts  Ecological and Biological Population Projections (intra-annual to multi-decadal, including SLR and model down-scaling)	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	Projecting Range Limits with Coupled Thermal Tolerance - Climate Change Models: An Example Based on Gray Snapper (Lutjanus griseus) along the U.S. East Coast	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	t	f	t	f	\N	f	t	f	f	f	NOAA Northeast Fishery Science Center (NEFSC), University of Florida	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	\N	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0052294	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

Due to the many unique features of the Estuary,\r\nsome aspects of changing climate may not be as severe here as in nearby watersheds and estuaries, whereas other changes may be more important. Since 2008, the Partnership for the Delaware Estuary has engaged experts from throughout the region to conduct an assessment of the vulnerabilities and adaptation options for three key resources of the Delaware Estuary: tidal\r\nwetlands, drinking water, and bivalve shellfish. These provide three case studies – a habitat case study, a human/water use case study, and a living resource case study – for looking at climate change impacts and how best to adapt to them here in the Delaware Estuary. These case studies represent the very first step in an adaptation planning process, the goal of which is to ensure the resiliency of this vast and valuable system as climate changes.   For all three case studies, the top concerns among experts are the vulnerabilities of key resources to sea‐level rise and salinity changes, and flooding and precipitation effects. Whereas, many estuaries around the world are concerned with sea‐level rise, the vulnerability to salinity rise in the Delaware Estuary is somewhat unique, and especially notable because this system has the world’s largest freshwater tidal prism. Adaptation actions are outlined for each resource as well.  	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Completed Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Climate Impacts on Water Resources Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic Delaware Infrastructure Managed Ecosystems Natural Ecosystems Biota Recreation and Tourism Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Physical Coastal and Oceanic Surface (Sea-surface temperature, sea level, salinity, ocean color, wave height) Sub-surface (e.g., temperature, salinity, nutrients, carbon, phytoplankton) Plans, Assessments, Studies Adaptation/Action Plan Risk and Vulnerability Engagement	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	Climate Change and the Delaware Estuary	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Partnership for the Delaware Estuary	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	t	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.delawareestuary.org/science_projects_climate_ready_products.asp	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	\N	f

Summarized from the abstract: The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) (indices of atmospheric variability and long-term sea surface temperature, respectively) were used to develop a model examining climate influences on Georges Bank cod recruitment.  A simple Cushing-type model was developed, and then expanded to include climate influences.  The resulting auto-regressive-integrative-moving average (ARIMA) type model (ARIMAX) produced reliable forecasts, and it is recommended that it be implemented in short term prediction for Georges Bank cod assessments and forecasts, as well as management strategies.	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Completed Sustainability of Marine Ecosystems Regional Or State New England Maine Massachusetts New Hampshire Managed Ecosystems Fisheries Forecasts and outlooks (monthly to annual, models)  Hindcasts (climatologies, models)	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	Broad-scale Climate Influences on Cod (Gadus morhua) Recruitment on Georges Bank	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Federal Research Institute for Rural Areas, Institute for Sea Fisheries; NOAA NMFS (National Marine Fisheries Service)	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://icesjms.oxfordjournals.org/content/68/3/592.full.pdf+html	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

The analytic framework couples the wetland change modeling in SLAMM (Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model) with traditional damage assessment methods via habitat equivalency analysis (HEA).   The report estimates gains and losses in the ecological service flows provided by coastal habitats as well as the type and size of projects necessary to maintain current wetland services.  Potentially, these projects can be either restoration of degraded habitats or preventative measures taken to avoid future loss.

This document is part of a project designed to generate climate-smart guidance for restoration and management projects to safeguard fish, wildlife, and their habitats from the impacts of climate change.   This coastal climate-smart guidance is an initial step to provide wildlife and natural resource managers  practical tools for ensuring that current and future projects are maximizing benefits to ecosystems and critical species. NWF convened an expert panel to develop a process for defining climate-smart conservation for the coastal system and to provide climate-smart options that natural resource managers could consider when planning and implementing projects. The panel selected two project types in the coastal environment on which to focus: coastal impoundments and living shorelines.  The coastal impoundment information was based significantly on the efforts of Delaware DFW to plan for sea-level rise and implement pilot adaptation projects to address sea-level rise impacts on their coastal impoundments.  	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Completed Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic Delaware Managed Ecosystems Natural Ecosystems Biota Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Training and Capacity Building Adaptation and Mitigation Guidance, including Best Practices Manuals, Toolkits, and Guides Other, report	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	Practical Guidance for Coastal Climate-Smart Conservation Projects in the Northeast Case Examples for Coastal Impoundments and  Living Shorelines	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	National Wildlife Federation	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.nwf.org/~/media/PDFs/Global-Warming/Climate-Smart-Conservation/Final%20coastal%20climate-smart%20guidance%20document.ashx\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

River herring are anadromous, and thus susceptible to marine and inland impacts; they are considered an important prey species for atlantic cod, striped bass, and flounder.  It was concluded that a series of workshops and assessments were necessary to determine the health of river herring populations.  NOAA invited expert presenters and the public to a series of workshops in 2012, one of which discussed climate change impacts, as well as identified data gaps and research needs; workshop proceedings were compiled into a report.

It directed the secretary of Energy and Environmental Affairs (EEA) to convene an advisory committee to develop a report, analyzing adaptation strategeis for projected climate changes. This report is by the Massachusetts Climate Change \r\nAdaptation Advisory Committee, and it is organized into two parts. Part I includes an overview of the observed and predicted changes to Massachusetts‘ climate and their anticipated impacts, key findings, a set of guiding principles, and key adaptation strategies, cutting across multiple sectors.  The second part of the report is organized into five  sections, including coastal zone and oceans as well as natural resources and habitat, key infrastructure, human health and welfare, and local economy and government. Each section includes a description of the vulnerabilities to climate change and  adaptation strategies that could help increase resilience and preparedness.  The coastal section focuses on the open ocean, bays, estuaries, salt marshes and tidal flats.  This section outlines vulnerabilities and adaptation strategies relating to land protection, policy, management and restoration, and monitoring.  The report also includes a section specific to wetlands, including coastal wetlands. Vulnerabilities relate to changes in temperature and precipitation, and adaptation strategies are identified relating to land protection, policy, management and restoration, and monitoring.	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Completed Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Changes in Extremes of Weather and Climate Regional Or State New England Massachusetts Public Health and Safety Infrastructure Managed Ecosystems Natural Ecosystems Biota Social and Cultural Resources Economic Resources Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Sustainability of Marine Ecosystems Climate Impacts on Water Resources Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Plans, Assessments, Studies Adaptation/Action Plan Recreation and Tourism	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	Massachusetts Climate Change Adaptation Report	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs and the Adaptation Advisory Committee	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	t	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	www.mass.gov/environment/cca \r\n	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	\N	f

Black carbon, a soot component, is a potent climate driver that absorbs sunlight in the atmosphere, changes rainfall patterns, and when deposited on snow and ice, accelerates melting. In addition, soot can cause direct effects on health and agriculture. Climate and other effects of soot are magnified in broad regions where the strongest source emissions occur, but transported soot is also a major concern in the Arctic. The short atmospheric lifetime of soot particles also means that emissions reductions produce nearly immediate results, in contrast to most greenhouse gases (GHGs).	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Completed Changes in Extremes of Weather and Climate National Public Health and Safety Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	BLACK CARBON: A Science/Policy Primer	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	\r\nPEW Center on Global Climate Change	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.c2es.org/publications/black-carbon-primer	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

IOOS®, established by law in\r\nMarch of 2009 and referred to in the statute as the Integrated Coastal Ocean\r\nObserving System, provides the framework for developing such a system.\r\nThe Act establishes a federal-regional partnership for understanding the unique\r\ncharacteristics of the nation’s diverse regions, integrating existing information\r\nfrom federal and non-federal sources, and expanding the observation network\r\nto fill critical gaps. IOOS® is a partnership of 17 Federal agencies and\r\n11 Regional Associations for Coastal Ocean Observing (RAs).\r\nThe need for more comprehensive and higher resolution data and information\r\nabout our coasts and Great Lakes has never been greater. Climate change,\r\nocean acidification, declining fish stocks, expanding dead zones, and the\r\nincreasing and sometimes conflicting uses of our coastal waters for food,\r\ntransportation, energy, mineral resources and recreation require an expanded\r\nnetwork of observations, enhanced analyses and understanding, and improved predictive and forecasting capabilities.	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Completed Ongoing Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Sustainability of Marine Ecosystems Regional Or State National Public Health and Safety Managed Ecosystems Infrastructure Natural Ecosystems Maps (Imagery, geo-referenced data) Projections (intra-annual to multi-decadal, including SLR and model down-scaling) Hindcasts (climatologies, models)	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	Providing Coastal Information in a Changing Climate	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	t	f	National Federation of Regional Associations For Coastal and Ocean Observing	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.usnfra.org/documents/03.10_RCBooklet_lo-res.pdf	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

Tornadoes, flooding, drought, and wildfires ravaged many parts of the country during the period, and each of these extremes broke long-standing records and have been compared to the 'worst such cases' in history. While similar extremes have occurred throughout modern American history, never before have they occurred in a single month. According to the Storm Prediction Center (SPC), there were 751 tornadoes during April alone, and the confirmed number of tornadoes surpassed the all-time monthly record of 542 tornadoes set in May 2003. Record rainfall along the Ohio River Valley, punctuated with snowmelt across the upper Midwest, caused record flooding along the mid and lower Mississippi River, with water levels surpassing the historic floods of 1927 and 1937. Above-normal precipitation and vegetative growth during 2010, followed by dry and windy conditions the first five months of 2011, created ideal wildfire conditions across the Southern Plains where millions of acres of land burned. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM), the same region experienced Extreme-to-Exceptional [D3-D4] drought following consecutive months that were record to near-record dry.	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Completed Changes in Extremes of Weather and Climate National Regional Or State South East Great Lakes Central Mid-Atlantic New England Viewers and Web-based Tools Hindcasts (climatologies, models) Maps (Imagery, geo-referenced data)	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	Spring 2011 U.S. Climate Extremes	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	NOAA, National Climatic Data Center	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/special-reports/2011-spring-extremes/	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

Such estimates are\r\nnecessary to design many river restoration projects. For projects that include\r\nconstructing new infrastructure or retrofitting existing infrastructure flood\r\nfrequency estimates are required to size the infrastructure to withstand\r\nfloods of specified magnitudes (e.g., events expected to recur every 100\r\nyears). For projects where infrastructure is being removed and a natural\r\nchannel restored (e.g., a dam removal) flood frequency estimates are\r\nalso useful because stream channel geometry, process, and habitat are\r\nvery closely linked with the magnitude of comparatively frequent flood\r\nevents—those with recurrence intervals between 1 and 5 years. Thus, flood\r\nfrequency estimates are necessary to understand how channel changes will\r\naffect stream biota and adjacent floodplain landowners.	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Completed Climate Impacts on Water Resources  Managed Ecosystems Fisheries Natural Ecosystems Biota Infrastructure Fresh Water Resources Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Regional Or State New England Infrastructure Assess Climate and its Impacts Forecasts of Climate Impacts  Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Plans, Assessments, Studies Impact Study	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	Flood Frequency Estimates for New England River Restoration Projects:\r\nConsidering Climate Change in Project Design	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	NOAA Fisheries Service	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.habitat.noaa.gov/pdf/flood_frequency_estimates.pdf	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	\N	f

To help cities become more resilient to the rising threats of climate change, NRDC reviewed more than 75 scientific studies and other reports to summarize the water-related vulnerabilities in 12 cities across the United States. Although there may still be some uncertainty about what particular impacts threaten cities and how quickly or severely they might occur, action at the local level is the most effective method of reducing, mitigating, and preventing the negative effects of water-related climate change outlined in this fact sheet. NRDC urges cities to prepare for coming challenges relating to water resources.

In particular,\r\na moderate-to-strong La Niña at the beginning of the\r\nyear dissipated during boreal spring but reemerged during\r\nfall. The phenomenon contributed to historical droughts\r\nin East Africa, the southern United States, and northern\r\nMexico, as well the wettest two-year period (2010–11)\r\non record for Australia, particularly remarkable as this\r\nfollows a decade-long dry period. Precipitation patterns\r\nin South America were also influenced by La Niña. Heavy\r\nrain in Rio de Janeiro in January triggered the country’s\r\nworst floods and landslides in Brazil’s history.\r\nThe 2011 combined average temperature across global\r\nland and ocean surfaces was the coolest since 2008, but\r\nwas also among the 15 warmest years on record and\r\nabove the 1981–2010 average. The global sea surface\r\ntemperature cooled by 0.1°C from 2010 to 2011, associated\r\nwith cooling influences of La Niña. Global integrals\r\nof upper ocean heat content for 2011 were higher than\r\nfor all prior years, demonstrating the Earth’s dominant\r\nrole of the oceans in the Earth’s energy budget. In the\r\nupper atmosphere, tropical stratospheric temperatures\r\nwere anomalously warm, while polar temperatures\r\nwere anomalously cold. This led to large springtime\r\nstratospheric ozone reductions in polar latitudes in both\r\nhemispheres. Ozone concentrations in the Arctic stratosphere\r\nduring March were the lowest for that period since\r\nsatellite records began in 1979. An extensive, deep, and\r\npersistent ozone hole over the Antarctic in September\r\nindicates that the recovery to pre-1980 conditions is\r\nproceeding very slowly.	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	 Completed Changes in Extremes of Weather and Climate International National Hindcasts (climatologies, models) Engagement Plans, Assessments, Studies Training and Capacity Building Education	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	State of the Climate in 2011	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	NOAA- American Metoerological Center	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/cmb/bams-sotc/climate-assessment-2011-lo-rez.pdf	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

It allows one home in on a particular area, like Lake Champlain, and there are several cells that cover the lake, One can pick a GCM scenario (there are several to choose from) and pick the version (hi, med, low) of the intensity of the change. As for variables, it's temperature and precipitation, month by month or season by season, and there are two periods of projections along with the current situation as modeled (for a base line). One can pick the projected temperature and precipitation or the change that the projection represents from the baseline.	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Completed Ongoing Changes in Extremes of Weather and Climate National Projections (intra-annual to multi-decadal, including SLR and model down-scaling) Forecasts and outlooks (monthly to annual, models)  Maps (Imagery, geo-referenced data) Viewers and Web-based Tools Visualization tools (web-based, mapping programs)	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	Climate Wizard	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	t	f	Nature Conservancy	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.climatewizard.org/	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

West, EPA, 703-347-8584,  west.jordan@epa.gov	f	f	f	f	January 2012	f	f	f	Abstract: The Massachusetts Bays Program (MBP) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) collaborated on an ecological vulnerability assessment, using a novel methodology based on expert judgment, to inform adaptation planning under EPA’s Climate Ready Estuaries Program. An expert elicitation-type exercise was created to systematically elicit judgments from experts in a workshop setting regarding climate change effects on two key ecosystem processes within salt marsh systems: sediment retention and community interactions. Specific workshop objectives were to assess (1) the relative influences of physical and ecological variables that regulate each process, (2) their relative sensitivities under current and future climate change scenarios, (3) the degree of confidence about these relationships, and (4) implications for management. For each process, an influence diagram was developed identifying key process variables and their interrelationships (influences). Using a coding scheme, each expert characterized the type and degree of each influence to indicate its nature and sensitivity under current and future climate change scenarios. The experts also discussed the relative impact of certain influences on the endpoints. This report demonstrates how particular pathways in such diagrams can be linked to management options and examined in the context of planning documents to identify opportunities for ‘mainstreaming’ adaptation into strategic planning.	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Completed Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Regional Or State New England Massachusetts Natural Ecosystems Coasts Estuaries Wetlands (e.g., saltwater, brackish, freshwater; tidal/non-tidal) Biota Other Sector  Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Plans, Assessments, Studies Adaptation/Action Plan Impact Study Risk and Vulnerability	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	Vulnerability Assessments in Support of the Climate Ready Estuaries Program: A Novel Approach Using Expert Judgement, Volume II: Results for the Massachusetts Bays Program	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Massachusetts Bays Program and the Environmental Protection Agency Climate Ready Estuaries Program	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/global/recordisplay.cfm?deid=241555#Download\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f

Specifically, this project visualizes various levels of sea level rise and/or storm surge flooding, in Falmouth on Cape Cod. The Geographic Information Systems (GIS) based flooding simulations incorporate the highest currently available MassGIS (DEM), local LIDAR datasets, and 3D measurements. The team utilized sophisticated inundation analysis and modeling tools as well as knowledge and expertise in mapping and analyzing flood potential from storms and sea level rise.  Storm surge level was extracted from the National Hurricane Center’s SLOSH (Sea, Lake and Overland Surges from Hurricanes) model. The MOM (Maximum of Maximum Envelope of Water) results were used for the chosen hurricane category. Using the MOM results ensures that the worst case storm surge at every location along the coastline is being considered. The SLOSH model outputs provide a spatially varying depiction of storm surge flooding along the coast. The team made use of a custom processing tool to propagate these variable results inland onto the elevation data.\r\n\r\nThe images represent multiple sea level changes both with and without storm surge (Category 2 Hurricane) flooding and allow users to leverage the Google Earth framework for navigation to areas of interest. 	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Completed Regional Or State New England Massachusetts Infrastructure Assess Climate and its Impacts Forecasts of Climate Conditions Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Coastal and Oceanic Surface (Sea-surface temperature, sea level, salinity, ocean color, wave height) Projections (intra-annual to multi-decadal, including SLR and model down-scaling) Viewers and Web-based Tools Visualization tools (web-based, mapping programs) Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise)	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	3D Visualization of Sea Level Rise: Illustrating the Potential to Exacerbate Storm Damage in Falmouth, Massachusetts\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Woods Hole Sea Grant\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.whoi.edu/seagrant/page.do?pid=55816\r\n	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

Thus, BioMap2 combines hundreds of individual pieces of geospatial data about the state’s species, ecosystems, and landscapes.\r\n\r\nThese elements of biodiversity falls into one of two complementary categories, Core Habitat and Critical Natural Landscape. Core Habitat identifies key areas to ensure the long-term persistence of species of conservation concern, exemplary natural communities, and intact ecosystems across the Commonwealth.  The specific subcomponents of Core Habitat are: Species of Conservation Concern; Priority Natural Communities;  Forest Core ; Aquatic Core; Wetland Core; and Vernal Pool Core.  Critical Natural Landscape identifies larger landscape areas that are better able to support ecological processes, disturbances, and wide-ranging species.  The specific subcomponents of Critical Natural Landscape are: Landscape Blocks; Foraging Habitat for Tern Species; Upland Buffers of Wetland Core; Upland Buffers of Aquatic Core; and Upland Habitat to Support Coastal Adaptation.  BioMap2 Core Habitat and Critical Natural Landscape overlap in many locations. Together, Core Habitat and Critical Natural Landscape identify 2.1 million acres that are key to the protection of our state's biodiversity.\r\n\r\nThe two elements of the BioMap2 protection strategy have a varied interplay across the Commonwealth. At times, the elements that drive the focused delineation of Core Habitat are nested within a buffer of Critical Natural Landscape. In other locations, Core Habitat or Critical Natural Landscape stands alone, taking the lead in identifying locations that warrant protection for specific elements of biodiversity or for the protection of larger ecological functions.	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Completed Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Regional Or State New England Massachusetts Managed Ecosystems Natural Ecosystems Biota Viewers and Web-based Tools	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	BioMap2: Conserving the Biodiversity of Massachusetts in a Changing World\r\n	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Massachusetts Division of Fish and Wildlife\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.mass.gov/dfwele/dfw/nhesp/land_protection/biomap/biomap_home.htm\r\n	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

Available data consist of “bare-earth” Digital Elevation Model (DEM) tiles that can be downloaded for free, and classified LAS files that can be ordered for small areas on DVD or larger areas on a user supplied hard drive.\r\nThese seventeen datasets cover most of eastern Massachusetts, as well as portions of Hampden County. The data can be used for emergency response, drainage studies and hydrologic / floodplain modeling, development suitability analysis and infrastructure planning, identification of structures and other man-made features, habitat classification, vegetation mapping and many other purposes.\r\nEach dataset represents a distinct data acquisition project with unique characteristics. Acquisition dates range from 2002 to 2011 and a variety of agencies and/or partnerships sponsored these missions – details can be found in the project specific metadata. Differences include the instruments used to acquire the data, processing software, accuracy, point spacing, format, projection, tiling schemes, and availability of derivative products such as contours and breaklines. Point and raster data are available for each project area. The point data are in ASCII text files storing XYZ coordinates, binary LAS files, or bare-earth TINs. The rasters are GeoTiffs.

The legislature directed the Task Force to “evaluate ways of protecting New York’s remaining coastal cosystems and natural habitats, and increasing coastal community resilience in the face of sea level rise, applying the best available science as to sea level rise and its anticipated impacts.”  The Task Force, with public input, has considered and researched the complex issues related to sea-level rise in the state, but a cost and benefit analysis of potential adaptation strategies to sea-level rise was beyond the scope of this report.  The conclusions and recommendations in this report are an important first step in increasing the resilience of New York's coastal communities, and they will need to be further assessed to determine site-specific applicability and how they will affect economic development, greenhouse gas mitigation efforst, the environment, etc.   	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Completed Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Climate Impacts on Water Resources Changes in Extremes of Weather and Climate Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic New York Public Health and Safety Infrastructure Energy Transportation Built Coast (e.g., engineered solutions for shoreline protection) Managed Ecosystems Communication and Commerce Natural Ecosystems Coasts Estuaries Wetlands (e.g., saltwater, brackish, freshwater; tidal/non-tidal) Beaches Social and Cultural Resources Recreation and Tourism Economic Resources Urban Vulnerable or Minority Populations Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Translation of Climate Science for Sector/Decision-Maker Use  Plans, Assessments, Studies Adaptation/Action Plan	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	f	f	New York State Sea Level Rise Task Force Report to the Legislature\r\n	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	New York State Sea Level Rise Task Force\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	t	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	t	http://www.dec.ny.gov/docs/administration_pdf/slrtffinalrep.pdf\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f

Observed climate trends and future climate projections were developed for seven regions in the state. For each sector, climate risks, vulnerabilities, and adaptation strategies are identified. Equity, environmental justice, and economics are themes that run across all sectors.  Case studies were developed that look at specific vulnerabilities and potential adaptation strategies for the eight sectors. These case studies also identify specific monitoring needs. Stakeholders participated in the development of the assessment in an effort to ensure the report would be applicable and useful to decision-makers in the state.   \r\n	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	t	f	t	\N	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	 Completed Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic New York Public Health and Safety Emergency Management Infrastructure Energy Communication and Commerce Fresh Water Resources Transportation Built Coast (e.g., engineered solutions for shoreline protection) Managed Ecosystems Natural Ecosystems Coasts Estuaries Wetlands (e.g., saltwater, brackish, freshwater; tidal/non-tidal) Inland Habitats and Watersheds  Beaches Biota Terrestrial Social and Cultural Resources Recreation and Tourism Urban Economic Resources Climate Impacts on Water Resources Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Changes in Extremes of Weather and Climate Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Risk Assessments Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Promote Public Climate Literacy Plans, Assessments, Studies Adaptation/Action Plan Risk and Vulnerability	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	Responding to Climate Change in New York State: The Climaid Integrated Assessment for Effective  Climate Change Adaptation in New York State (Technical Report)\r\n	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	NYSERDA (New York State Energy Research and Development Authority)\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	t	t	\N	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	http://www.nyserda.ny.gov/Publications/Research-and-Development/Environmental/EMEP-Publications/Response-to-Climate-Change-in-New-York.aspx\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	t	\N	f

This case study looks at how hypoxia in the Chesapeake Bay is affected by climate variabilty and projected climate change and what this may mean in terms of obstacles to existing ecosystem restoration.  The case study uses past observations to determine the various impacts climate may have on hypoxia and what the results are for the ecosystem.   Using this information, the case study includes a projection of how climate change is likely to affect hypoxia, and how climate change will affect attainment of restoration goals.\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	 Completed Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic Virginia Marlyland Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Natural Ecosystems Estuaries Biota Inland Habitats and Watersheds  Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Assess Climate and its Impacts Forecasts of Climate Impacts  Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Physical Coastal and Oceanic Sub-surface (e.g., temperature, salinity, nutrients, carbon, phytoplankton) Other Impact Study	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	Coastal Dead Zones and Global Climate Change Ramifications of Climate Change for Chesapeake Bay Hypoxia\r\n	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Pew Center on Global Climate Change, University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.c2es.org/docUploads/Regional-Impacts-Chesapeake.pdf	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

For this report, SLAMM 5.0 model was applied to the entire Chesapeake Bay region and Delaware bay, a study area comprising slightly over seven million hectares.  The study area was broken into 30 meter by 30 meter cells for this application. This report provides coastal resource managers and other relevant decision-makers with much needed information about local impacts of sea-level rise on the Chesapeake Bay’s coastal habitats to help them assess the risks and identify reasonable steps to manage those risks. Ultimately, the appropriate response strategies will vary for different areas, and site-specific studies may be warranted to supplement these findings by identify factors that have not effectively characterized by the model or are uncertain. However, the results of this analysis can be used to inform a number of important decisions regarding coastal restoration and management.	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Completed Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic Marlyland Delaware Virginia Natural Ecosystems Estuaries Coasts Wetlands (e.g., saltwater, brackish, freshwater; tidal/non-tidal) Beaches Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Forecasts of Climate Impacts  Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Plans, Assessments, Studies Vulnerability Assessment Maps (Imagery, geo-referenced data) Risk and Vulnerability Physical Coastal and Oceanic Surface (Sea-surface temperature, sea level, salinity, ocean color, wave height)	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	Sea-Level Rise and Coastal Habitats in the Chesapeake Bay Region\r\n	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	National Wildlife Federation	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.nwf.org/~/media/PDFs/Global-Warming/Reports/FullSeaLevelRiseandCoastalHabitats_ChesapeakeRegion.ashx \r\n	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f

This report presents the results of EcoAdapt’s efforts to survey, inventory, and assess adaptation projects from different regions, jurisdictions, and scales throughout North America’s marine and coastal environments. \r\n\r\nFirst, we provide a summary of climate changes and impacts, including temperature changes, sea level rise, precipitation changes, air and water circulation changes, and changes in ocean chemistry, on the marine and coastal environments of the United States, Canada, and Mexico. \r\n\r\nSecond, we provide a summary of commonly used adaptation approaches and examples from our inventory of projects. We separate the examples, representing diverse activities, sectors, and targeted climate impacts, into four broad categories:1. Natural Resource Management and Conservation, 2. Capacity Building, 3. Infrastructure, Planning, and Development, and 4. Governance and Policy.   Adaptation examples are presented and organized by the following geographic regions: \r\nArctic Canada (Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut), Eastern Canada and Northeast USA (New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec; Maine, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island), MidAtlantic USA (Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, District of Columbia, Virginia), Southeast/Gulf USA (North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas), Gulf of Mexico and Yucatan Peninsula – Mexico (Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Tabasco, Campeche, Yucatan, Quintana Roo), Alaska and British Columbia, Pacific States USA (Washington, Oregon, California, Hawaii), Baja Peninsula and Pacific Coast – Mexico (Baja California, Baja California Sur, Sonora, Sinaloa, Nayarit, Jalisco, Colima, Michoacan, Guerrero, Oaxaca, Chiapas), Nationwide USA, Nationwide Canada, and Nationwide Mexico. Finally, the report concludes with a discussion of the common barriers and trends uncovered by the inventory of adaptation projects.\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	 Completed Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Sustainability of Marine Ecosystems Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Changes in Extremes of Weather and Climate Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Regional Or State New England Mid-Atlantic South East Infrastructure Managed Ecosystems Natural Ecosystems Inland Habitats and Watersheds  Biota Social and Cultural Resources Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Plans, Assessments, Studies, report	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	The State of Marine and Coastal Adaptation in North America: A Synthesis of Emerging Ideas\r\n	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	EcoAdapt\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://ecoadapt.org/data/library-documents/EcoAdapt_Marine%20and%20Coastal%20Synthesis%20Report_January%202011_Final.pdf\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

Leaders in the region recognize the need to be proactive in adapting to such changes, but do not yet have the resources and tools they require to do so successfully. This report presents a snapshot of the needs of local, regional and state governments in undertaking such climate preparedness efforts. The goal is to target assistance effectively, and to help our partners in this effort—policy-makers, NGOs and others—do the same.\r\nThe research was conducted in 2010 and early 2011 and involved extensive individual interviews as well as an online survey distributed to more than 200 communities.  The responses, which were well distributed throughout the region, indicate the following:\r\nNortheast communities are concerned about climate change impacts.\r\n• Over half who responded are already doing some form of climate preparedness planning. \r\n• Another third are concerned, but are unsure what steps to take or lack capacity. \r\n• Sea-level rise, increased precipitation, floodplain changes, and public welfare and health are the impacts of greatest concern. In order to progress, they need technical, communications, and financial assistance.\r\n• The technical need most often ranked as a top priority (by 35 percent of respondents) is help with infrastructure vulnerability assessments.	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Completed Regional Or State New England Mid-Atlantic Plans, Assessments, Studies Infrastructure Public Health and Safety Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Rhode Island Connecticut Vermont Massachusetts New Hampshire Maine Social and Cultural Resources Economic Resources Assess Climate and its Impacts Needs and Capacity Assessments Changes in Extremes of Weather and Climate Needs Assessment	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	Preparing for the Changing Climate: A Northeast-Focused Needs Assessment	f	f	t	f	t	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Clean Air Cool Planet	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.cleanair-coolplanet.org/climate_preparedness/NortheastAssessment2011.pdf	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

The report focuses on projected impacts of climate change on natural communities, using examples from Mass Audubon and protected lands throught the state.  The impact on cultural resources and natural history is also described.  Much of the information is synthesized from two key peer reviewed sources: the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report (IPCC 2007) and the Northeast Climate Impact Assessment’s 2007 report (Frumhoff et al. 2007).  Sections include: Changes in the Massachusetts climate, Terrestrial ecosystems, Freshwater ecosystems, Coastal and near-shore marine ecosystems, Birds and their habitats, and Pathogens and Pests.\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Completed Regional Or State New England Massachusetts Managed Ecosystems Natural Ecosystems Biota Social and Cultural Resources Managed Ecosystems Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Plans, Assessments, Studies Risk and Vulnerability	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	Some Anticipated Consequences of Global Warming: Implications for the Nature of Massachusetts \r\n	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Mass Audubon	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.massaudubon.org/PDF/cleanenergy/massaudubon_climate_change_paper.pdf\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

Similarly, it is useful to look at specific examples of coastal adaptation to understand how states can adapt more generally.  This report looks at impacts in three states: Florida, Ohio, and Texas, and at adaptation efforts in Maryland, Massachusetts, and California.  This report also discusses how other states can learn from what these states have been doing to address climate change as well as discusses what is needed to undertake these types of actions such as federal funding.   \r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Completed Regional Or State New England Massachusetts Mid-Atlantic Marlyland Great Lakes Ohio Public Health and Safety Infrastructure Managed Ecosystems Natural Ecosystems Biota Social and Cultural Resources Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Changes in Extremes of Weather and Climate Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Other report Plans, Assessments, Studies, report	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	The Faces of Climate Change Adaptation:  The Need for Proactive Protection of the Nation’s Coasts  \r\n	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	t	f	f	Coastal States Organization\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://coastalstates.org.seedevelopmentprogress.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/CSO-White-Paper-on-Climate-Change-Adaptation-May-2010.pdf\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

This is an overlap of two areas: policies addressing sea level rise as a result of climate change, and conservation policies. The intersection of these two policy areas can be neglected. Policies on sea level rise often focus only on protecting human development, and conservation policies often do not incorporate a dynamic coastline...This is an attempt to comprehensively summarize how each coastal state is addressing this issue. The focus is not on a theoretical summary of adaptation options, but summarizing what has actually been done (both in creating policy and implementing it). The primary purpose is to serve as a reference for the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council (CRMC) as it plans its own sea level rise policy, but it can hopefully be similarly relevant for other states.	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Completed Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Regional Or State New England New Hampshire Maine Massachusetts Connecticut Rhode Island Mid-Atlantic New York New Jersey Pennsylvania Marlyland Delaware Virginia Infrastructure Managed Ecosystems Natural Ecosystems Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Assess Climate and its Impacts Plans, Assessments, Studies, report South East North Carolina South Carolina	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	Survey of State Initiatives for Conservation of Coastal Habitats from Sea-Level Rise\r\n	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	t	f	t	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

Using scientific literature and policy-related documents, the SAP describes the physical environments; potential changes to coastal environments, wetlands, and vulnerable species; societal impacts and implications of sea-level rise; decisions that may be sensitive to sea-level rise; opportunities for adaptation; and institutional barriers to adaptation. The SAP also outlines the policy context in the mid-Atlantic region and describes the implications of sea-level rise impacts for other regions of the United States. Finally, this SAP discusses ways natural and social science research can improve understanding and prediction of potential impacts to aid planning and decision making.\r\n\r\nProjections of sea-level rise for the twenty-first century vary widely, ranging from several centimeters to more than a meter. Rising sea level can inundate low areas and increase flooding, coastal erosion, wetland loss, and saltwater intrusion into estuaries and freshwater aquifers. Existing elevation data for the mid-Atlantic United States do not provide the degree of confidence needed for local decision making. Systematic nationwide collection of high-resolution elevation data would improve the ability to conduct detailed assessments in support of planning. The coastal zone is dynamic and the response of coastal areas to sea-level rise is more complex than simple inundation. Much of the United States consists of coastal environments and landforms such as barrier islands and wetlands that will respond to sea-level rise by changing shape, size, or position. The combined effects of sea-level rise and other climate change factors such as storms may cause rapid and irreversible coastal change.  All these changes will affect coastal habitats and species. Increasing population and development in coastal areas also affects the ability of natural ecosystems to adjust to sea-level rise.\r\n\r\nCoastal communities and property owners have responded to coastal hazards by erecting shore protection structures, elevating land and buildings, or relocating inland.  Accelerated sea-level rise would increase the costs and environmental impacts of these responses. Shoreline armoring can eliminate the land along the shore to which the public has access; beach nourishment projects often increase access to the shore.\r\nPreparing for sea-level rise can be justified in many cases, because the cost of preparing now is small compared to the cost of reacting later. Examples include wetland protection, flood insurance, longlived infrastructure, and coastal land-use planning. Nevertheless, preparing for sea-level rise has been the exception rather than the rule. Most coastal institutions were based on the implicit assumption that sea level and shorelines are stable. Efforts to plan for sea-level rise can be thwarted by several institutional biases, including government policies that encourage coastal development, flood insurance maps that do not consider sea-level rise, federal policies that prefer shoreline armoring over soft shore protection, and lack of plans delineating which areas would be protected or not as sea level rises.\r\n\r\nThe prospect of accelerated sea-level rise and increased vulnerability in coastal regions underscores the immediate need for improving our scientific understanding of and ability to predict the effects of sea-level rise on natural systems and society. These actions, combined with development of decision support tools for taking adaptive actions and an effective public education program, can lessen the economic and environmental impacts of sea-level rise.\r\n	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Completed Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic New York New Jersey Pennsylvania Marlyland Delaware Virginia District Of Columbia Infrastructure Managed Ecosystems Natural Ecosystems Public Health and Safety Biota Social and Cultural Resources Recreation and Tourism Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Plans, Assessments, Studies	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	Coastal Sensitivity to Sea-Level Rise: A Focus on the Mid-Atlantic Region, Synthesis and Assessment Product 4.1\r\n	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	U.S. Climate Change Science Program	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	t	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.climatescience.gov/Library/sap/sap4-1/final-report/default.htm\r\n	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

Predicting the form and magnitude of coastal changes is important for understanding the impacts to humans and the environment. Presently, the ability to predict coastal changes is limited by the scientific understanding of the many variables and processes involved in coastal change, and the lack of consensus regarding the validity of existing conceptual, analytical, or numerical models. In order to assess potential future coastal changes in the mid-Atlantic U.S. for the U.S. Climate Change Science Program (CCSP), a workshop was convened by the U.S. Geological Survey. Assessments of future coastal change were made by a committee of coastal scientists with extensive professional experience in the mid-Atlantic region. Thirteen scientists convened for a two-day meeting to exchange information and develop a consensus opinion on potential future coastal changes for the mid-Atlantic coast in response to sealevel rise. Using criteria defined in past work, the mid-Atlantic coast was divided into four geomorphic compartments: spits, headlands, wave-dominated barriers, and mixed-energy barriers.  A range of potential coastal responses was identified for each compartment based on four sea-level rise scenarios.  The four scenarios were based on the assumptions that: a) the long-term sea-level rise rate observed over the 20th century would persist over the 21st century, b) the 20th century rate would increase by 2 mm/yr, c) the 20th century rate would increase by 7 mm/yr, or d) sea-level would rise by 2 m over the next few hundred years.  Potential responses to these sea-level rise scenarios depend on the landforms that occur within a region and include increased likelihood for erosion and shoreline retreat for all coastal types, increased likelihood for erosion, overwash and inlet breaching for barrier islands, as well as the possibility of a threshold state (e.g., dramatic change in barrier evolution, such as segmentation or disintegration) for some barrier island systems.  The likelihood of the potential coastal responses is expressed using standard terminology employed in climate change assessments (e.g., as used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and CCSP).  This assessment was based on the coastal geomorphology in its present condition and does not consider any coastal protection that might be undertaken in the future. The committee recognized that a variety of erosion mitigation measures have been implemented along developed portions of the coast and these are very likely to be applied in the future. It was also acknowledged that economics, political will, and other factors can drive decisions to implement these measures, and that such decisions cannot be predicted with confidence. The results of this assessment are depicted graphically on maps of the study area.\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Completed Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Natural Ecosystems Coasts Assess Climate and its Impacts Forecasts of Climate Impacts  Maps (Imagery, geo-referenced data) Plans, Assessments, Studies	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	Potential for Shoreline Changes Due to Sea-Level Rise Along the U.S. Mid-Atlantic Region\r\n	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	U.S. Geological Survey\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://woodshole.er.usgs.gov/pubs/of2007-1278/images/report.pdf\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

Employing a recent high-resolution edition of the National Elevation Dataset and using VDatum, a newly available tidal model covering the contiguous US, together with data from the 2010 Census, we quantify low-lying coastal land, housing and population relative to local mean high tide levels, which range from  0 to 3 m in elevation (North American Vertical Datum of 1988). Previous work at regional to national scales has sometimes equated elevation with the amount of sea level rise, leading to underestimated risk anywhere where the mean high tide elevation exceeds 0 m, and compromising comparisons across regions with different tidal levels. Using our tidally adjusted approach, we estimate the contiguous US population living on land within 1 m of high tide to be 3.7 million. In 544 municipalities and 38 counties, we ﬁnd that over 10% of the population lives below this line; all told, some 2150 towns and cities have some degree of exposure. At the state level, Florida, Louisiana, California, New York and New Jersey have the largest sub-meter populations. We assess topographic susceptibility of land, housing and population to sea level rise for all coastal states, counties and municipalities, from 0 to 6 m above mean high tide, and ﬁnd important threat levels for widely distributed communities of every size. We estimate that over 22.9 million Americans live on land within 6 m of local mean high tide.\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Completed Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Regional Or State New England Mid-Atlantic South East Infrastructure Public Health and Safety Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Risk Assessments Forecasts of Climate Impacts  Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Physical Coastal and Oceanic Surface (Sea-surface temperature, sea level, salinity, ocean color, wave height) Projections (intra-annual to multi-decadal, including SLR and model down-scaling) Maps (Imagery, geo-referenced data) Plans, Assessments, Studies, report	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	Tidally Adjusted Estimates of Topographic Vulnerability to Sea Level Rise and Flooding for the Contiguous United States\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Climate Central\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/7/1/014033/pdf/1748-9326_7_1_014033.pdf\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

Invasive species, which are non-native species that cause environmental or economic damages or human-health impacts, also contribute to ecosystem changes. The interactions between stressors and invasive species, although not well understood, may exacerbate the impacts of climate change on ecosystems, and likewise, climate change may enable further invasions. This report reviews available literature on climate-change effects on aquatic invasive species (AIS) and examines state-level AIS management activities. Data on management activities came from publicly available information, was analyzed with respect to climate-change effects, and was reviewed by managers. This report also analyzes state and regional AIS management plans to determine their capacity to incorporate information on changing conditions generally, and climate change specifically. Although there is no mandate that directs states to consider climate change in AIS management plans, state managers can consider predicted effects of climate change on prevention, control, and eradication in order to manage natural resources effectively under changing climatic conditions. Further scientific research and data collection are needed in order to equip managers with the tools and information necessary to conduct effective AIS management in the face of climate change.

Policy-makers and resource managers must now prepare for the impacts from climate change and support implementing such plans on the ground. In this paper we argue that climate change challenges the region to maintain its economic viability, but also holds some opportunities that may enhance economic development, human well-being, and social justice. To face these challenges and seize these opportunities effectively we must better understand adaptation capacities, opportunities and constraints, the social processes of adaptation, approaches for engaging critical players and the broader public in informed debate, decision-making, and conscious interventions in the adaptation process. This paper offers a preliminary qualitative assessment, in which we emphasize the need for (1) assessing the feasibility and side effects of technological adaptation options, (2) increasing available resources and improving equitable access to them, (3) increasing institutional flexibility, fit, cooperation and decision-making authority, (4) using and enhancing human and social capital, (5) improving access to insurance and other risk-spreading mechanisms, and (6) linking scientific information more effectively to decision-makers while engaging the public. Throughout, we explore these issues through illustrative sectoral examples. We conclude with a number of principles that may guide the preparation of future adaptation plans for the Northeast.\r\n	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Completed Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Changes in Extremes of Weather and Climate Regional Or State New England Mid-Atlantic Public Health and Safety Infrastructure Managed Ecosystems Natural Ecosystems Economic Resources Social and Cultural Resources Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Plans, Assessments, Studies	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	Adaptation to Climate Change in the Northeast United States: Opportunities, Processes, Constraints\r\n	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://climate.yale.edu/sites/default/files/Yohe_2008_Adaptation%20to%20climate%20change%20in%20the%20Northeast%20United%20States_opportunities%20processes%20constraints_0.pdf\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

The conference, the largest gathering on refuges and conservation in more than a decade, drew members of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the agency responsible for the refuge system, other federal agency employees, representatives of state wildlife agencies that assist with refuge planning and management, staffers from nonprofit conservation and outdoor recreation groups and interested citizens and journalists. Among the featured presentations was “Refuges, Neighbors and Sea-level Rise,” a workshop organized and led by Noah Matson of Defenders of Wildlife and Mike Bryant and Lou Hinds of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. This report is based on the presentations and discussions of that workshop.

Here, we investigate the inﬂuence of sea level rise on expected storm surge-driven water levels and their frequencies along the contiguous United States. We use model output for global temperature changes, a semi-empirical model of global sea level rise, and long-term records from 55 nationally distributed tidal gauges to develop sea level rise projections at each gauge location. We employ more detailed records over the period 1979–2008 from the same gauges to elicit historic patterns of extreme high water events, and combine these statistics with anticipated relative sea level rise to project changing local extremes through 2050. We ﬁnd that substantial changes in the frequency of what are now considered extreme water levels may occur even at locations with relatively slow local sea level rise, when the difference in height between presently common and rare water levels is small. We estimate that, by mid-century, some locations may experience high water levels annually that would qualify today as ‘century’ (i.e., having a chance of occurrence of 1% annually) extremes. Today’s century levels become ‘decade’ (having a chance of 10% annually) or more frequent events at about a third of the study gauges, and the majority of locations see substantially higher frequency of previously rare storm-driven water heights in the future. These results add support to the need for policy approaches that consider the non-stationarity of extreme events when evaluating risks of adverse climate impacts.\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Completed Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Regional Or State New England Mid-Atlantic South East Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Risk Assessments Forecasts of Climate Impacts  Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Coastal and Oceanic Surface (Sea-surface temperature, sea level, salinity, ocean color, wave height) Physical Projections (intra-annual to multi-decadal, including SLR and model down-scaling) Maps (Imagery, geo-referenced data) Plans, Assessments, Studies	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	Modeling Sea Level Rise Impacts on Storm Surges Along US Coasts\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Climate Central\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/7/1/014032/pdf/1748-9326_7_1_014032.pdf\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

The ability to visualize the potential depth and inland extent of water gives us a better understanding of the corresponding impacts and consequences.  Mapping sea level changes in a geographic information system (GIS) gives the user the ability to overlay the potentially impacted areas with other data such as critical infrastructure, roads, ecologically sensitive areas, demographics, and economics.  Providing maps on the Web via Internet mapping technologies enables the user to have an interactive experience that truly brings out the “visual” part of the map definition.  Over the past several years, the lessons learned from investigating pilot sea level change mapping applications have led to the development of a next-generation sea level rise and coastal flooding viewer.  In addition, new mapping techniques have been developed to use high-resolution data sources to show flooding impacts on local public infrastructure, mapping confidence, flooding frequency, marsh impacts, and social and economic impacts from potential inundation.  This paper will provide a brief history of previous sea level change visualization pilot projects, detailed discussion of new methods, current status of new tool development and outputs, and future plans for expanding to the rest of the U.S.\r\n	f	t	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Completed Regional Or State New England Mid-Atlantic Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Public Health and Safety Infrastructure Managed Ecosystems Natural Ecosystems Biota Social and Cultural Resources Recreation and Tourism Economic Resources Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Downscale Climate Models Economic Impacts Social Impacts (Health and Public Security) Forecasts of Climate Impacts  Projections (intra-annual to multi-decadal, including SLR and model down-scaling) Maps (Imagery, geo-referenced data) Plans, Assessments, Studies Risk and Vulnerability Viewers and Web-based Tools	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	New Mapping Tool and Techniques For Visualizing Sea Level Rise And Coastal Flooding Impacts\r\n	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	NOAA Coastal Services Center\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.csc.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/_/pdf/New-Mapping-Tool-and-Techniques-for-Visualizing-SLR-Impacts.pdf\r\n	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

During the twentieth century, climate change has had documented impacts on ecological systems, and impacts are expected to increase as climate change continues and perhaps even accelerates. This technical input to the National Climate Assessment synthesizes our scientific understanding of the way climate change is affecting biodiversity, ecosystems, ecosystem services, and what strategies might be employed to decrease current and future risks. Building on past assessments of how climate change and other stressors are affecting ecosystems in the United States and around the world, we approach the subject from several different perspectives. First, we review the observed and projected impacts on biodiversity, with a focus on genes, species, and assemblages of species. Next, we examine how climate change is affecting ecosystem structural elements—such as biomass, architecture, and heterogeneity—and functions—specifically, as related to the fluxes of energy and matter. People experience climate change impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems as changes in ecosystem services; people depend on ecosystems for resources that are harvested, their role in regulating the movement of materials and disturbances, and their recreational, cultural, and aesthetic value. Thus, we review newly emerging research to determine how human activities and a changing climate are likely to alter the delivery of these ecosystem services. \r\nThis technical input also examines two cross-cutting topics.  First, we recognize that climate change is happening against the backdrop of a wide range of other environmental and anthropogenic stressors, many of which have caused dramatic ecosystem degradation already.  This broader range of stressors interacts with climate change, and complicates our abilities to predict and manage the impacts on biodiversity, ecosystems, and the services they support. The second cross-cutting topic is the rapidly advancing field of climate adaptation, where there has been significant progress in developing the conceptual framework, planning approaches, and strategies for safeguarding biodiversity and other ecological resources. At the same time, ecosystem-based adaptation is becoming more prominent as a way to utilize ecosystem services to help human systems adapt to climate change.\r\nIn this summary, we present key findings of the technical input, focusing on themes that can be found throughout the report. Thus, this summary takes a more integrated look at the question of how climate change is affecting our ecological resources, the implications for humans, and possible response strategies. This integrated approach better reflects the impacts of climate in the real world, where changes in ecosystem structure or function will alter the viability of different species and the efficacy of ecosystem services. Likewise, adaptation to climate change will simultaneously address a range of conservation goals.  Case studies are used to illustrate this complete picture throughout the report; a snapshot of one case study, 2011 Las Conchas, New Mexico Fire, is included in this summary.\r\n	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Ongoing Sustainability of Marine Ecosystems Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Changes in Extremes of Weather and Climate Climate Impacts on Water Resources Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Regional Or State Infrastructure Managed Ecosystems Natural Ecosystems Biota Social and Cultural Resources Economic Resources Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Translation of Climate Science for Sector/Decision-Maker Use  Plans, Assessments, Studies	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	Impacts of Climate Change on Biodiversity, Ecosystems, and Ecosystem Services: Technical Input to the 2013 National Climate Assessment.\r\n	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	t	f	U.S. Global Change Research Program\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	http://downloads.usgcrp.gov/NCA/Activities/Biodiversity-Ecosystems-and-Ecosystem-Services-Technical-Input.pdf\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	\N	f

However, previous characterizations of these ecosystem services have typically been based on a small number of historical studies, and the consistency and extent to which marshes provide these services has not been investigated. Here, we review the current evidence for the specific processes of wave attenuation, shoreline stabilization and floodwater attenuation to determine if and under what conditions salt marshes offer these coastal protection services.\r\nMethodology/Principal Findings: We conducted a thorough search and synthesis of the literature with reference to these processes. Seventy-five publications met our selection criteria, and we conducted meta-analyses for publications with sufficient data available for quantitative analysis. We found that combined across all studies (n = 7), salt marsh vegetation had a significant positive effect on wave attenuation as measured by reductions in wave height per unit distance across marsh vegetation. Salt marsh vegetation also had a significant positive effect on shoreline stabilization as measured by accretion, lateral erosion reduction, and marsh surface elevation change (n = 30). Salt marsh characteristics that were positively correlated to both wave attenuation and shoreline stabilization were vegetation density, biomass production, and marsh size. Although we could not find studies quantitatively evaluating floodwater attenuation within salt marshes, there are several studies noting the negative effects of wetland alteration on water quantity regulation within coastal areas.\r\nConclusions/Significance: Our results show that salt marshes have value for coastal hazard mitigation and climate change adaptation. Because we do not yet fully understand the magnitude of this value, we propose that decision makers employ natural systems to maximize the benefits and ecosystem services provided by salt marshes and exercise caution when making decisions that erode these services.\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Completed Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Changes in Extremes of Weather and Climate National Natural Ecosystems Assess Climate and its Impacts Social Impacts (Health and Public Security) Plans, Assessments, Studies Impact Study	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	The Protective Role of Coastal Marshes: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis\r\n	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0027374\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

Protecting and managing habitat quality is vital to an organism’s persistence, and essential to endangered species recovery. We conducted an investigation of habitat quality and potential impacts from climate change to piping plovers (Charadrius melodius) breeding on the barrier island ecosystem of New York, during 2003-2005. Our first step in this analysis was to examine the relationship between two common measures of habitat quality: density and productivity (Chapter 1). We used both central and limiting tendency data analysis to find that density significantly limited productivity across many spatial scales, especially broader scales. \r\n\r\nOur analysis of plover habitat quality (Chapter 2) focused on 1) identifying the spatial scaling of plovers to their environment; 2) determining the relative importance of four aspects of the environment (land cover, predation, management, and disturbance); and 3) determining the key environmental variables that influence productivity. We found that plover habitat selection occurred within a narrow range of spatial scales that was unique to each environmental variable. Further, we found that management and predation variables influenced population-level productivity relatively more than land cover and disturbance. Environmental variables with a significant positive influence on habitat quality were land management units, plover conservation educational signs, and symbolic string fencing erected around plover nesting areas. We found a significant negative relationship among density of people on ocean beaches, herring gull density, and land cover degradation.\r\n\r\nTo quantify possible impact to plover habitat from future climate change (Chapter 3), we examined the extent of habitat change resulting from different estimates of sea level rise (SLR) and storminess over the next 100 years. We found that the particular SLR estimate, habitat response, and storm type used to model climate changes influenced the amount of potential habitat available. Importantly, we observed synergy between SLR\r\nand storms resulting in the increasing impact of SLR and storms on plover habitat over the next 100 years. Finally, we found that coastal development contributed considerably to habitat loss when combined with climate changes.\r\n\r\nOur findings raise concerns regarding current plover recovery goals and management strategies. Density-dependent productivity may threaten the goal of a joint increase in both plover population and productivity. We advocate density monitoring and allocation of alternative nesting areas to provide the relief of possible high-density limitations. Based on our analysis of habitat selection and climate change threats, we call for a shift in management focus away from known breeding areas, towards ecosystem processes. Long-term conservation of piping plover habitat quality is more likely through protecting and promoting natural barrier island dynamics (i.e., overwash and migration) and minimizing human development on the barrier islands of New York State.\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Completed Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic New York Natural Ecosystems Biota Assess Climate and its Impacts Forecasts of Climate Impacts  Plans, Assessments, Studies Risk and Vulnerability Impact Study	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	Piping Plover (Charadrius Melodius) Conservation on the Barrier Islands of New York: Habitat Quality and Implications in a Changing Climate\r\n	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	University of Massachusetts - Amherst\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://scholarworks.umass.edu/open_access_dissertations/120/\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

In New England, existing salt marshes developed over the last 3000-4000 years in congruence with a post-glacial decline in the rate of relative sea level rise from about 2.5 mm/yr to 1 mm/yr. Recent studies indicate that the rate has increased again to about 2.4 mm/yr and that associated changes in vegetation zones have occurred in marshes along the southern coast of New England. This acceleration of sea level rise forecasts significant changes to the coastal environment in Southern Rhode Island, creating challenges for the long-term viability of land restoration and conservation projects.\r\n\r\nMy project used geographic information systems and a Sea Level Affecting\r\nMarsh Model (SLAMM) to predict alterations to coastal wetlands in Charlestown and\r\nWesterly, RI. Into the model I input a Digital Elevation Model built with high resolution\r\nelevation data derived from LIght Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) technology and detailed coastal wetland maps to enhance the effectiveness of the model in predicting the\r\nsite specific effects of accelerated sea level rise. In addition, I used geospatial land use data to analyze the relative impact of human development on projected salt marsh\r\nmigration.\r\n\r\nModel simulations project a minimum of a 44% reduction in net salt marsh\r\nhabitat by 2100 with 1 m of global sea level rise when all dry land is subject to\r\ninundation. The model projects a reduction of 65% under 2 m of sea level rise and a\r\nsimilar land protection strategy. A qualitative analysis of the model-generated maps\r\nshows that almost all salt marsh existing in 1999 will be gone by 2075 in all sea level rise predictions tested and that the salt marsh habitat existing in 2100 will develop in areas that are currently freshwater wetland or dry land. Additional analysis of the changes within each pond identified specific locations projected to support salt marsh\r\ndevelopment over the next century.\r\n\r\nThese results could prove highly beneficial to land managers as they prepare for\r\nthe effects of accelerated sea level rise in the coastal zone and for coastal ecologists\r\ninterested in determining the long term viability of habitat restoration projects.	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Completed Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Regional Or State New England Rhode Island Natural Ecosystems Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Forecasts of Climate Impacts  Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Coastal and Oceanic Surface (Sea-surface temperature, sea level, salinity, ocean color, wave height) Physical Ecological and Biological Plans, Assessments, Studies Maps (Imagery, geo-referenced data) Projections (intra-annual to multi-decadal, including SLR and model down-scaling) Vulnerability Assessment Risk and Vulnerability	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	Using GIS and Simulation Modeling to Assess the Impact of Sea Level Rise on Coastal Salt Marshes	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	University of Rhode Island, Kingston	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.edc.uri.edu/mesm/EVS502/Docs/Hancock_MajorPaper.pdf	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

Low-elevation sandy beaches, important nesting habitat for the continued recovery of the federally threatened piping plover (Charadrius melodus), are especially vulnerable to slr. Coastal Rhode Island, despite dense development, has been an increasingly productive area for piping plover during the last two decades, adding significantly to the species’ recovery in New England. Understanding to what extent these low-lying piping plover nesting beaches can retreat landward is key for prioritizing long-term habitat conservation and management actions. This research examines habitat change in response to slr under stationary and migration habitat responses and whether development blocks habitat migration for five important piping plover nesting beaches in Rhode Island. For the stationary model, all the study beaches (East Beach Watch Hill, Quonochontaug, Ninigret, Green Hill, and Trustom Pond) lose plover habitat under all slr projections (i.e., 0.5, 1, 1.5 m), with lower lying beaches experiencing greater loss. Total habitat loss ranges from 5% (0.5 m) to 23% (1.5 m) in the 100- year study timeframe. At the highest slr level, East Beach loses 48% of current habitat, while Green Hill Beach loses 1% of current habitat. For the migration model, habitat on all five beaches expands under the lowest slr scenario (0.5 m). Habitat continues to expand for four of the beaches at the mid-range slr scenario (1 m). At the highest slr scenario (1.5 m), habitat continues to expand for two beaches and contracts for three beaches. For the migration model, development blocks the creation of 6.6 to 8.4 ha of habitat on four beaches. However, the majority of piping plover habitat will migrate inland if unconstrained by additional development or shoreline protection structures. East Beach shows the greatest habitat migration potential and Green Hill Beach the least. To manage for preservation of habitat, overwash processes should be encouraged and development limited on East Beach, Quonochontaug Beach, Ninigret Beach, Trustom Pond (Moonstone Beach), and the center of Green Hill Beach. This study provides beach-specific input for land management decisions affecting piping plover habitat preservation for the municipalities of Westerly, Quonochontaug, Charlestown, Green Hill, and South Kingstown and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, Rhode Island National Wildlife Refuge Complex. In addition, these impending beach configuration changes present an opportunity for increased cooperation among coastal zone managers, wildlife managers, coastal residents, and businesses to engage in land management practices that provide ecological,economic, and recreational benefits to local communities by preserving beach habitat.\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Completed Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Regional Or State New England Rhode Island Natural Ecosystems Biota Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Translation of Climate Science for Sector/Decision-Maker Use  Plans, Assessments, Studies Impact Study	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	Effects of Projected Sea Level Rise on Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus) Nesting Habitat in Rhode Island\r\n	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Antioch University New England\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

However, many coastal hazard mitigation plans do not consider sea level rise when assessing storm surge risk. Here we apply a GIS-based approach to quantify potential changes in storm surge risk due to sea level rise on Long Island, New York. We demonstrate a method for combining hazard exposure and community vulnerability to spatially characterize risk for both present and future sea level conditions using commonly available national data sets. Our results show that sea level rise will likely increase risk in many coastal areas and will potentially create risk where it was not before. We find that even modest and probable sea level rise (.5 m by 2080) vastly increases the numbers of people (47% increase) and property loss (73% increase) impacted by storm surge. In addition, the resulting maps of hazard exposure and community vulnerability provide a clear and useful example of the visual representation of the spatial distribution of the components of risk that can be helpful for developing targeted hazard mitigation and climate change adaptation strategies. Our results suggest that coastal agencies tasked with managing storm surge risk must consider the effects of sea level rise if they are to ensure safe and sustainable coastal communities in the future.\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Completed Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic New York Infrastructure Natural Ecosystems Forecasts of Climate Impacts  Assess Climate and its Impacts Plans, Assessments, Studies Impact Study	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	Assessing Future Risk: Quantifying the Effects of Sea Level Rise on Storm Surge Risk for the Southern Shores of Long Island, New York\r\n	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	The Nature Conservancy	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11069-011-0046-8\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

In contrast, we use simulations from five numerical models to\r\nquantify the conditions under which ecogeomorphic feedbacks allow coastal wetlands to adapt to projected changes in sea level. In contrast to previous sea‐level assessments,\r\nwe find that non‐linear feedbacks among inundation, plant growth, organic matter accretion, and sediment deposition, allow marshes to survive conservative projections of sea‐level rise where suspended sediment concentrations are greater than ∼20 mg/L. Under scenarios of more rapid sea‐level rise (e.g., those that include ice sheet melting), marshes will likely submerge near the end of the 21st century. Our results emphasize that in areas of rapid geomorphic change, predicting the response of ecosystems to climate change requires consideration of the ability of biological processes to modify their physical environment.	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Completed Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) National Natural Ecosystems Plans, Assessments, Studies Impact Study Assess Climate and its Impacts Forecasts of Climate Impacts 	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	Limits on the Adaptability of Coastal Marshes to Rising Sea Level\r\n	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://people.virginia.edu/~mlk4n/papers/Kirwan2010GRL.pdf	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

To this end, scientists from the Carolinas Integrated Sciences and Assessments (CISA), United States Geological Survey (USGS) South Carolina Water Science Center, and Advanced Data Mining International (ADMi) investigated the threat of saltwater intrusion in the Yadkin-Pee Dee River (YPDR) basin under conditions influenced by ongoing and future climatic change, with an emphasis on changes in the frequency and duration of saltwater intrusion events with increasing sea levels. In addition, project leaders enhanced a decision support system (DSS) that is relevant and user-friendly to incorporate planning for future coastal climate change.

This Tool Kit focuses on land-use tools that could be used to adapt to impacts to the built environment (public and private coastal development and infrastructure). In order to devise a comprehensive strategy, governments will need to determine which tools to employ given their unique socio-economic and political contexts. To this end, we also provide policymakers with a framework for decision making. We analyze each tool by (1) the type of power exercised to implement it (planning, regulatory,\r\nspending, or tax and market-based tools); (2) the policy objective that it facilitates (protection, accommodation, planned retreat, or preservation); and (3) the type of existing or potential land uses that the tool can be used to adapt (critical infrastructure, existing development, developable lands, and undevelopable lands). Finally, we provide a top-level analysis of the trade-offs between tools—the economic, environmental, and social costs and benefits, and the legal and administrative feasibility of implementing each tool.\r\n	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Completed Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) National Infrastructure Natural Ecosystems Social and Cultural Resources Economic Resources Training and Capacity Building Adaptation and Mitigation Guidance, including Best Practices Manuals, Toolkits, and Guides Management Guidance (i.e. structured decision making) Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Provision of Guidance Documents	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	Adaptation Tool Kit: Sea-Level Rise and Coastal Land Use How Governments Can Use Land-Use Practices to Adapt to Sea-Level Rise	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Georgetown Climate Center\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.georgetownclimate.org/sites/default/files/Adaptation_Tool_Kit_SLR.pdf\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

This document describes a general approach for establishing a NERRS Sentinel Sites Program to understand climate change impacts, as well as the context of  the NERRS Sentinel Sites Program in relationship to a larger NOAA Sentinel Site Program. The specific goal of  this document is to provide guidance for the NERRS and NERRS partners to establish Sentinel Sites for understanding the impacts of  sea level/lake level change and  inundation on coastal habitats.  It also contributes to the NERRS System-wide Monitoring Program \r\n(SWMP) as a SWMP Application Module. Although the initial focus of  the NERRS Sentinel Sites Program will be on changes in marsh, mangrove, and submerged aquatic vegetation responses related to changes in sea level/lake level and inundation, we anticipate that in the future other documents would be developed to provide guidance for NERRS Sentinel Sites that are established to address the effects of  other climate-related stressors on coastal habitat.\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Completed Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Changes in Extremes of Weather and Climate Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats National Natural Ecosystems Wetlands (e.g., saltwater, brackish, freshwater; tidal/non-tidal) Assess Climate and its Impacts Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Training and Capacity Building Adaptation and Mitigation Guidance, including Best Practices Manuals, Toolkits, and Guides	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	Sentinel Sites Program Guidance for Understanding Climate Change Impacts\r\n	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	NOAA, National Estuarine Research Reserve System\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.nerrs.noaa.gov/Doc/PDF/Research/SentinelSiteReport2012.pdf\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f

People need the associated tools, training, and information that turn data into information capable of making a difference.  The NOAA Coastal Services Center built the prototype in 2008 and then reached out to potential users to provide feedback and guide the development of the site. These project partners, whose organizations eventually formed the Digital Coast Partnership, let the Center know what issues were most important, what type of content they would find most helpful, and the primary barriers they needed addressed.  The partnership list is extensive including federal, state, county, NGO, academic, and professional partners.  The website contains coastal datasets related to topics such as benthic, hydrography, land cover, imagery, elevation (LiDAR), etc.  It also includes tools that support coastal decision-making around issues such as adaptation, land use planning, coastal hazards, water quality, economy, etc.  It also includes trainings on similar topics.

The strength of this tool is its ability to visually show the modeling of sea level rise predictions, allowing people to see the impacts in a more intuitive way.\r\nIt provides tools for improved understanding of results from research projects that use Version 2.0. SLAMM-View was designed for a user-friendly, workflow-based approach to assess impacts of sea-level rise on coastal areas with both visualization and analysis functionality. SLAMM-View provides simultaneous comparison between both current and future conditions out to the year 2100, and among different sea-level rise scenarios (e.g., 0.4 meter vs. 1 meter), using interactive maps and tabular reporting capabilities. The model simulations include 5 main processes that affect wetland fate under sea-level rise: innundation, erosion, overwash, saturation, and salinity.  \r\nTo date, SLAMM-View provides access to SLAMM simulation results for the entire coastlines of 5 states, and partial coverage of an additional 4 states.	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	 Ongoing Completed National Regional Or State New England Mid-Atlantic South East New Jersey Marlyland Delaware Virginia District Of Columbia Natural Ecosystems Coasts Estuaries Wetlands (e.g., saltwater, brackish, freshwater; tidal/non-tidal) Oceans Inland Habitats and Watersheds  Beaches Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Improve Scientific Understanding of the Climate System and Essential Climate Variables Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Downscale Climate Models Forecasts of Climate Conditions Forecasts of Climate Impacts  Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Physical Surface (air temperature, precipitation, wind) Surface (Sea-surface temperature, sea level, salinity, ocean color, wave height) Coastal and Oceanic Sub-surface (e.g., temperature, salinity, nutrients, carbon, phytoplankton) Climate Society Interactions Decision Making Risk Assessment or Risk Management Policy Planning In situ Observations Depth and Elevation Data Maps (Imagery, geo-referenced data) Projections (intra-annual to multi-decadal, including SLR and model down-scaling) Impact Study Risk and Vulnerability Viewers and Web-based Tools Visualization tools (web-based, mapping programs)	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Sea-Level Rise Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM) Web-based Application	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	Provide a web based tool that displays pairs of maps of the same area at different levels of sea levels and the projected changes to marshes.	f	f	f	t	f	U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.fws.gov/slamm/	f	f	t	t	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f

Such events create significant public health needs that can exceed local capacity to respond, resulting in excess morbidity or mortality and in the declaration of disasters. Human vulnerability to any disaster is a complex phenomenon with social, economic, health, and cultural dimensions. Vulnerability to natural disasters has two sides: the degree of exposure to dangerous hazards (susceptibility) and the capacity to cope with or recover from disaster consequences (resilience). Vulnerability reduction programs reduce susceptibility and increase resilience. Susceptibility to disasters is reduced largely by prevention and mitigation of emergencies. Emergency preparedness and response and recovery activities--including those that address climate change--increase disaster resilience. Because adaptation must occur at the community level, local public health agencies are uniquely placed to build human resilience to climate-related disasters. This article discusses the role of public health in reducing human vulnerability to climate change within the context of select examples for emergency preparedness and response.	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	 Completed Climate Impacts on Water Resources National Regional Or State Public Health and Safety Indirect Climate Hazards Vector-Borne Illness (e.g., West Nile Virus, Lymes disease) Infrastructure Engagement	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	Building Human Resilience: The Role of Public Health Preparedness and Response as an Adaptation to Climate Change \r\n	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	National Center for Environmental Health, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, CDC	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18929977	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

ARIES allows users to model and quantify the impacts of landscape feature changes on the provision of ecosystem services, thereby allowing the evaluation and comparison of alternative scenarios for climate change, land use, or land cover scenarios and policies for addressing them. Modeling the flow of ecosystem services from their source to use locations allows critical pathways (and their intersections) to be identified that are necessary for one or more services to travel across time and space. This information can be used to establish sensible and sustainable policies for governing land development, habitat protection, and ecosystem restoration efforts. ARIES can be used in any geographical area to explicitly map the linkages between ecosystems that provide services and particular groups of human beneficiaries.

Consequently, there has been an increased focus on developing modeling or other analytical approaches to evaluate potential impacts to inform coastal management. This report provides the data that were used to develop and evaluate the performance of a Bayesian network designed to predict long-term shoreline change due to sea-level rise. The data include local rates of relative sea-level rise, wave height, tide range, geomorphic classification, coastal slope, and shoreline-change rate compiled as part of the U.S. Geological Survey Coastal Vulnerability Index for the U.S. Atlantic coast. In this project, the Bayesian network is used to define relationships among driving forces, geologic constraints, and coastal responses. Using this information, the Bayesian network is used to make probabilistic predictions of shoreline change in response to different future sea-level-rise scenarios.	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 National Infrastructure Natural Ecosystems Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Assess Climate and its Impacts Risk Assessments Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Coastal and Oceanic Surface (Sea-surface temperature, sea level, salinity, ocean color, wave height) Projections (intra-annual to multi-decadal, including SLR and model down-scaling) Risk and Vulnerability Plans, Assessments, Studies	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	A Bayesian Network to Predict Vulnerability to Sea-Level Rise: Data Report	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Robert Thieler, USGS, rthieler@usgs.gov	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/601/	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

The framework addresses three issues complicating assessments of climate change impacts--linkages across spatial scales, linkages across temporal scales, and linkages across scientific and management disciplines. A major theme underlying the framework is that, due to current limitations in modeling capabilities, assessing and responding to climate change should be approached from the perspective of risk assessment and management rather than as a prediction problem. The framework is based generally on ecological risk assessment and similar approaches. A second theme underlying the framework is the need for close collaboration among climate scientists, scientists interested in assessing impacts, and resource managers and decision makers. A case study illustrating an application of the framework is also presented that provides a specific, practical example of how the framework was used to assess the impacts of climate change on water quality in a Mid-Atlantic, U.S., watershed.	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) National Regional Or State Public Health and Safety Infrastructure Managed Ecosystems Natural Ecosystems Biota Social and Cultural Resources Recreation and Tourism Economic Resources Climate Impacts on Water Resources Mid-Atlantic Other	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	A Framework for Assessing Climate Change Impacts on Water and Watershed Systems	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	EPA Office of Research and Development	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18830740	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	\N	f

The Commission also included local government representatives and state lawmakers. The Action Plan includes an outline of impacts and recommendations related to natural resources and the coastal environment. Examples include  a recommendation to acquire LiDAR data for the state, to develop a state sea-level rise plan, and that the Virginia Institute of Marine Science should assess the vulnerability of coastal and marine living resource restoration efforts to climate change, particularly those for oysters and submerged aquatic vegetation, to climate change and recommend specific steps to increase the likelihood of success under changing conditions.\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Completed Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic Virginia Public Health and Safety Infrastructure Managed Ecosystems Natural Ecosystems Biota Social and Cultural Resources Recreation and Tourism Endangered, Threatened, or Protected Species Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Climate Impacts on Water Resources Changes in Extremes of Weather and Climate Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Plans, Assessments, Studies Adaptation/Action Plan Risk and Vulnerability	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	Final Report: A Climate Change Action Plan (Virginia)\r\n	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Governor's Commission on Climate Change, Virginia Department of Environmental Quality\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	t	t	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.sealevelrisevirginia.net/docs/homepage/CCC_Final_Report-Final_12152008.pdf\r\n	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	\N	f

Fourteen participants attended this workshop, along with CBEP and ICF staff.  Workshop participants were associated with several land trusts from across maine and regional organization such as Beginning with Habitat, Manomet Center for Conservation Sciences, Maine Geological Survey, Maine Coast Heritage Trust, and the Maine Land Trust Network.  Land trusts at the workshop included Portland Trails (Land Trust for Portland), Portland North Land Trust Collaborative, Western Foothills Land Trust, Loon Echo Land Trust, Harpswell Heritage Land Trust, and Brunswick Topsham Land Trust.  The objectives of the workshop were: ""(1) examine the potential impacts of climate change on land trusts; (2) foster discussion that will assist land trusts in incorporating climate change considerations into the planning process; and (3) gather information from the meeting to support a report to the wider Maine land trust community with findings on climate adaptation issues of concern to land trusts, information needs to support land trust climate adaptation planning, and tools to support planning efforts (flow charts, critical questions, ecological goals).\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Completed Regional Or State New England Maine Natural Ecosystems Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Assess Climate and its Impacts Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Other, workshop report	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	Casco Bay Workshop on Land Trusts and Climate Change Adaptation Report\r\n	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Casco Bay Estuary Partnership\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.cascobay.usm.maine.edu/cre_report.html\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

The policies also state that the Council’s sea level rise policies are based upon the CRMC’s legislative mandate to preserve, protect, and where possible, restore the coastal resources of the state through comprehensive and coordinated long-range planning.  Finally, the policy outlines that it is the Council’s policy to accommodate a base rate of expected 3 to 5 foot rise in sea level by 2100 in the siting, design, and implementation \r\nof public and private coastal activities and to insure proactive stewardship of coastal ecosystems under these changing conditions. It additionally allows for updating these values. \r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Completed Regional Or State New England Rhode Island Climate Impacts on Water Resources Plans, Assessments, Studies	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Program Regulations \r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Program\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	\N	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.crmc.ri.gov/regulations/RICRMP.pdf\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	\N	f

This informaiton can assist a community in understanding where hazards may be more likely to occur.   To help determine where high hazard areas are within a community or the coastal zone , the New Jersey Coastal Management Office developed a geospatial, composite overlay model or a coastal vulnerability index.  The model includes six  geospatial inputs, including  storm surge inundation scenarios, low slopes, flood prone areas, poorly drained soils, erosion prone areas, and geomorphology.  By incorporating sea level rise scenarios into storm \r\nsurge models, the Coastal Management Office could visually demonstrate how climate \r\nchange may shift high hazard areas further inland overtime.  This coastal vulnerability assessmnet may be useful in identifying locations for the investment of mitigation assistance.  It may also identify where engineering and adaptation actions to address climate change may be extremely difficult or ineffective.

The authors project future sea level rise based on historical measurements and global scenarios, and apply them to digital elevation models to demonstrate the vulnerability of New Jersey's coast.  The authors estimate that 1 to 3 % of New Jersey’s land area will be  affected by inundation and 6.5 to over 9 % by episodic coastal flooding over the next century.  Possible impacts to natural systems and socioeconomic impacts are also summarized.  A range of adaptation and mitigation options for the coastal area are also outlines.  The report suggests that where possible a gradual withdrawal of development from some areas of the New Jersey coast may be the optimum management strategy for protecting natural ecosystems. \r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Completed Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic New Jersey Infrastructure Managed Ecosystems Natural Ecosystems Biota Social and Cultural Resources Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Improve Scientific Understanding of the Climate System and Essential Climate Variables Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Forecasts of Climate Impacts  Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Coastal and Oceanic Surface (Sea-surface temperature, sea level, salinity, ocean color, wave height) Sub-surface (e.g., temperature, salinity, nutrients, carbon, phytoplankton) Maps (Imagery, geo-referenced data) Plans, Assessments, Studies Adaptation/Action Plan Risk and Vulnerability	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	Future Sea-Level Rise and the New Jersey Coast: Assessing Potential Impacts and Opportunities\r\n	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs Princeton University\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://cdn.publicinterestnetwork.org/assets/sR9N-sL9cXyA7pGI_ODVlw/Future_Sea_Level_Rise.pdf\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

Rather, there are spatial variations of SLR superimposed on a global average rise. These variations are forced by dynamic processes, arising from circulation and variations in temperature and/or salinity, and by static equilibrium processes, arising from mass redistributions changing gravity and the Earth’s rotation and shape. These sea-level variations form unique spatial patterns, yet there are very few observations verifying predicted patterns or fingerprints. Here, we present evidence of recently accelerated SLR in a unique 1,000-km-long hotspot on the highly populated North American Atlantic coast north of Cape Hatteras and show that it is consistent with a modelled fingerprint of dynamic SLR. Between 1950–1979 and 1980–2009, SLR rate increases in this northeast hotspot were ~ 3–4 times higher than the global average. Modelled dynamic plus steric SLR by 2100 at New York City ranges with Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scenario from 36 to 51 cm (ref. 3); lower emission scenarios project 24–36 cm (ref. 7).

Discussions have begun on how to reduce and eventually eliminate the rapid and accelerating additions of carbon dioxide, other greenhouse gases, and other pollutants to the world’s atmosphere and oceans. These efforts are vitally important and urgent for Maine and the rest of the world.  This report considers past change over geologic time, recent evidence of accelerated rates of change, and the implications of continued climate change in Maine during the 21st century as a result of greenhouse gas emissions and their associated pollutants. Even if a coordinated response succeeds in eliminating excess greenhouse gas emissions by the end of the century, something that appears highly unlikely today, climate change will continue because the elevated levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) can persist in the atmosphere for thousands of years to come.  It includes a section on the Gulf of Maine as well as other sectors that relate to the coastal environment. \r\n	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Completed Regional Or State New England Maine Public Health and Safety Infrastructure Managed Ecosystems Natural Ecosystems Social and Cultural Resources Economic Resources Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Climate Impacts on Water Resources Changes in Extremes of Weather and Climate Assess Climate and its Impacts Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Plans, Assessments, Studies	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	Maine's Climate Future: An Initial Assessment\r\n	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	University of Maine, Climate Change Institute\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://climatechange.umaine.edu/research/publications/climate-future	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	\N	f

Heritage also ran the G1 to G3 plants in the state through the CCVI.  In addition, they used Manomet's (Hector Galbraith's) non-coastal habitat vulnerability assessment model for its ecolofical communities. Both processes and results were peer-reviewed.  For the coastal species and habitats, Heritage is assessing Tier 1 and Tier 2 sites in the Action Plan and looking at where the sites fall in terms of a range of sea-level rise scenarios (0-2, 2-5. 5-10 feet).  This helps determine which sites and species located there might be influenced by sea-level rise. This information will be used in the update of the Wildlife Action Plan due to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 2015; however, the approach taken to integrate this information has not yet been determined.  	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Ongoing Completed Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic Marlyland Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Natural Ecosystems Biota Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Translation of Climate Science for Sector/Decision-Maker Use 	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	Maryland State Wildlife Action Plan Update	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	t	f	Maryland Department of Natural Resources, Division of Wildlife and Heritage	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

This assessment provided a pilot to support a larger project focused on developing a handbook for integrating Climate Change Adaptation into CCP revisions at National Wildlife Refuges.  In this assessment, potential implications of salt- water inundation and habitat loss from SLR and increased storm surge elevations, as well as change in ecosystem/habitat composition due to changes in land use and land cover (i.e. conversion from natural conditions) were modeled to estimate responses by priority resources.  Focus was placed on biological and infrastructure resources of critical importance.  Biological resources included rare species populations and mapped habitat of known importance for migratory bird species and monarch butterflies, while infrastructure resources included structures and infrastructure necessary for the recreational and educational missions of the Refuge Complex (e.g. kiosks, roadways, visitor center).  Spatial input data were most accessible and accurate for the Refuge Complex proper, and modeling outputs were most informative there as well.  However, the study area included the entirety of the Virginia Eastern Shore (i.e. supporting landscape).  Using NatureServe Vista, an ArcGIS extension Decision Support Tool, scenarios were modeled for timesteps of 2025, 2050, 2075 and 2100.  Outputs included tabular and map summaries of predicted changes in available habitat for priority biological and infrastructure resources.  	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Completed Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic Virginia Infrastructure Managed Ecosystems Natural Ecosystems Biota Social and Cultural Resources Recreation and Tourism Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Plans, Assessments, Studies Risk and Vulnerability	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	Resource Vulnerability Assessment and Strategies for Management Options for the Eastern Shore of Virginia and Fisherman Island National Wildlife Refuge	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	NatureServe, Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation – Division of Natural Heritage and 	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	t	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.fws.gov/refuges/whm/pdfs/EasternShoreVirginiaNWR_RVA_Report.pdf	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

Users can interactively view various data layers (e.g., tide gauge stations, marine protected areas, access points, eelgrass beds, etc.) over a backdrop of aerial photographs, political boundaries, natural resources, human uses, bathymetry, or other data including Google base maps. Users can quickly create and share maps and download the actual data for use in a Geographic Information System (GIS). While designed for coastal management professionals, MORIS can be used by anyone interested in these data and maps. It includes elevation information, but it does not include sea-level rise projections.	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Completed Regional Or State New England Massachusetts Infrastructure Managed Ecosystems Natural Ecosystems Biota Social and Cultural Resources Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Physical Ecological and Biological Climate Society Interactions Other Maps (Imagery, geo-referenced data) Viewers and Web-based Tools	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	Massachusetts Ocean Resource Information System	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management Program	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.mass.gov/czm/mapping/index.htm\r\n	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

As coastal populations continue to grow, and community infrastructures are threatened by erosion, there is increased demand for accurate information regarding past and present shoreline changes. There is also need for a comprehensive analysis of shoreline movement that is regionally consistent. To meet these national needs, the Coastal and Marine Geology Program of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is conducting an analysis of historical shoreline changes along open-ocean sandy shores of the conterminous United States and parts of Alaska and Hawaii. A primary goal of this work is to develop standardized methods for mapping and analyzing shoreline movement so that internally consistent updates can periodically be made to record shoreline erosion and accretion.     This report on the New England and Mid-Atlantic coasts is the fifth in a series of reports on historical shoreline change.  This report, like the earlier reports, summarizes the methods of analysis, interprets the results, provides explanations regarding long-term and short-term trends and rates of change, and describes how different coastal communities are responding to coastal erosion.                                                                                                                                             	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 National Regional Or State New England Mid-Atlantic Risk Assessments Assess Climate and its Impacts Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Risk and Vulnerability Plans, Assessments, Studies	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	National Assessment of Shoreline Change: Historical Shoreline Change along the New England and Mid-Atlantic Coasts	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	USGS	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	\N	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2010/1118/	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

Summaries of these findings at a state-by-state level are available in fact sheets at SurgingSeas.org/factsheets.  The original peer-reviewed studies can be found via SurgingSeas.org/papers.  All findings reflect best estimates from the research; actual values may vary. This report focuses on new research and analysis, not recommendations; but it is clear from the findings here that in order to avoid the worst impacts, the United States must work to slow sea level rise by reducing emissions of heat-trapping gases, and work to diminish the remaining danger by preparing for higher seas in coastal cities and counties everywhere.  SurgingSeas.org/plans lists a selection of existing resources, plans and efforts to prepare, from local to national levels.\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Completed Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise)  National Public Health and Safety Infrastructure Managed Ecosystems Natural Ecosystems Social and Cultural Resources Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Forecasts of Climate Impacts  Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Projections (intra-annual to multi-decadal, including SLR and model down-scaling) Maps (Imagery, geo-referenced data) Plans, Assessments, Studies	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	Surging Seas: Sea Level Rise, Storms and Global Warming’s Threat to the US Coast 	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Climate Central\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://slr.s3.amazonaws.com/SurgingSeas.pdf\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

It also identifies those areas where research is most needed to improve knowledge and understand the uncertainties regarding them. The report suggests a suite of potential actions that land and resource managers could use to improve the likelihood of success for the resources they manage, even under conditions of incomplete understanding of what drives thresholds of change and when changes will occur. These reports are intended to help the CCSP develop future program research priorities.	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Regional Or State Completed Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Natural Ecosystems Managed Ecosystems Improve Scientific Understanding of the Climate System and Essential Climate Variables Assess Climate and its Impacts Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Plans, Assessments, Studies	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	Thresholds of Climate Change in Ecosystems	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	USGS	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://downloads.climatescience.gov/sap/sap4-2/sap4-2-final-report-all.pdf	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

This document updates a\r\nreport published by EPA in 2010.\r\nVarious government agencies, academic institutions,\r\nand other organizations contributed data critical to\r\nthe development of this report. EPA also received\r\nfeedback from a diverse group of scientists, researchers,\r\nand communications experts in the public and\r\nprivate sectors. This feedback helped to inform the\r\ncontent and new features of this 2012 report. All\r\nof the indicators in this report are based on data\r\nthat have been collected and compiled according\r\nto protocols accepted by the scientific community.\r\nThe indicators were chosen using a standard set of\r\ncriteria that considered usefulness, objectivity, data\r\nquality, transparency, ability to meaningfully communicate,\r\nand relevance to climate change. In addition,\r\nthe report was peer-reviewed by independent\r\ntechnical experts.\r\n\r\nClimate Change Indicators in the United States, 2012,\r\nis written with the primary goal of informing readers’\r\nunderstanding of climate change. In addition to\r\npresenting climate change observations and trends\r\nin the United States and globally, this report highlights\r\nthe far-reaching significance of these changes\r\nand their possible consequences for people, the environment,\r\nand society.\r\nThis report is also designed to be useful for scientists,\r\nanalysts, decision-makers, educators, and\r\nothers who can use climate change indicators as a\r\ntool for:\r\n• Assessing trends in environmental quality, factors\r\nthat influence the environment, and effects on\r\necosystems and society.\r\n• Effectively supporting science-based decisionmaking\r\nand communication.\r\n• Evaluating existing and future climate-related\r\npolicies and programs.	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	 Completed Changes in Extremes of Weather and Climate Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Climate Impacts on Water Resources Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Sustainability of Marine Ecosystems National International Regional Or State Public Health and Safety Natural Ecosystems Social and Cultural Resources Assess Climate and its Impacts Improve Scientific Understanding of the Climate System and Essential Climate Variables Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Promote Public Climate Literacy Plans, Assessments, Studies Impact Study	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	Climate Change Indicators in the United States, 2nd Edition\r\n	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	U.S. EPA, Office of Atmospheric Programs, Climate Change Division	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/science/indicators/download.html	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	\N	f

State and local agencies in particular, as well as the federal government, need to consider what they will have to do differently if the 100-year flood arrives every decade or so, if the protected areas for threatened species are no longer habitable, or if a region can expect more frequent and more severe wildfires, hurricanes, droughts, water shortages, or other extreme environmental events. Both conceptually and practically, people and organizations will have to adjust what may be life-long assumptions to meet the potential consequences of climate change. How and where should bridges be built? What zoning rules may need to be changed? How can targets for reduced carbon emissions be met? These and myriad other questions will need to be answered in the coming years and decades.\r\n\r\nInforming Decisions in a Changing Climate examines the growing need for climate-related decision support--that is, organized efforts to produce, disseminate, and facilitate the use of data and information in order to improve the quality and efficacy of climate-related decisions. Drawing on evidence from past efforts to organize science for improved decision making, it develops guidance for government agencies and other institutions that will provide or use information for coping with climate change. This volume provides critical analysis of interest to agencies at every level, as well as private organizations that will have to cope with the world's changing climate.	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Completed National Management Guidance (i.e. structured decision making) Training and Capacity Building decision support	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	Informing Decisions in a Changing Climate	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	National Research Council	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12626	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

There are nine reports in this series, one each for eight regions defined by the NCA, and one for the contiguous U.S. The eight NCA regions are the Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, Great Plains, Northwest, Southwest, Alaska, and Haiwaii/Pacific Islands. While the datasets and simulations in these regional climate documents are not, by themselves, new (they have been previously published in various sources), these documents represent a more complete and targeted synthesis of historical and emission-dependent future climate conditions around the specific regions of the NCA.\r\n\r\nThere are two components of these descriptions. One component is a description of the historical climate conditions in the region. The other component is a description of the climate conditions associated with two future pathways of greenhouse gas emissions based on IPCC emission scenarios.	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Completed Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Changes in Extremes of Weather and Climate National Regional Or State New England Mid-Atlantic South East Central Great Lakes Assess Climate and its Impacts Improve Scientific Understanding of the Climate System and Essential Climate Variables Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Forecasts of Climate Conditions Forecasts of Climate Impacts  Projections (intra-annual to multi-decadal, including SLR and model down-scaling) Maps (Imagery, geo-referenced data) Plans, Assessments, Studies Other, report	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	Regional Climate Trends and Scenarios for the U.S. National Climate Assessment	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	NOAA National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Services.	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/technical_reports/142_Climate_Scenarios.html	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

The report notes that using a collaborative approach to obtain lidar data makes sense as that decreases agency costs while meeting multiple needs. However, not all data will fit everyone’s needs. \r\nThe statewide lidar coverage came from two separate collection projects implemented two years apart.  When the projects were proposed, few in the state were familiar with the LiDAR or had the capacity to work with such large data sets.\r\nUnderstanding what  initial users want to do with the data provides only part of the information needed. Understanding potential data uses and the requirements of the end user helps ensure that the data stay valuable by meeting present and future needs.\r\nThe availability of statewide LiDAR data in Delaware was delayed because project participants had to integrate non-standardized data sets and formats. Based on lessons learned from the two projects, future LiDAR collection project in Delaware will begin by identifying common end user goals. In addition, the following measures will be taken:\r\n• Data specifications and formats will be standardized\r\n• The end user’s technical capacity will be considered\r\n• All deliverables will be described adequately to ensure complete delivery\r\n• End users will review the contracts before their final acceptance	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Completed Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic Delaware Natural Ecosystems Coastal and Oceanic Surface (Sea-surface temperature, sea level, salinity, ocean color, wave height) Physical Other Training and Capacity Building Data Support tools (help using specific data products)	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	Lessons Learned from Delaware LiDAR	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Delaware Coastal Programs	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.csc.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/_/pdf/de_lessons.pdf\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

In order of increasing uncertainty, it is projected that sea level, temperature and streamflow will increase in the MAC region in response to higher levels of atmospheric\r\nCO2. A case study for Delaware based on digital elevation models suggests that, by the end of the 21st\r\ncentury, 1.6% of its land area and 21% of its wetlands will be lost to an encroaching sea. Sea-level rise\r\nwill also result in higher storm surges, causing 100 yr floods to occur 3 or 4 times more frequently by\r\nthe end of the 21st century. Increased accretion in coastal wetlands, however, which may occur in\r\nresponse to increases in CO2, temperature, and streamflow, could mitigate some of the flooding effect\r\nof sea-level rise. Warming alone will result in northward displacements of some mobile estuarine species and will exacerbate the already low summer oxygen levels in mid-Atlantic estuaries because of\r\nincreased oxygen demand and decreased oxygen solubility. Streamflow increases could substantially\r\ndegrade water quality, with significant negative consequences for submerged aquatic vegetation and\r\nbirds. Though climate change may have some positive impacts on the MAC region, such as increased\r\ncoastal tourism due to warming and some ecological benefits from less-frequent harsh winters, most\r\nimpacts are expected to be negative. Policies designed to minimize adverse ecological impacts of\r\nhuman activities on coastal ecosystems in the mid-Atlantic, such as decreases in nutrient loading of\r\nwatersheds, could help mitigate some of the risks associated with future climate variability and change\r\nin this region.	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Changes in Extremes of Weather and Climate Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Completed Climate Impacts on Water Resources Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic Natural Ecosystems Assess Climate and its Impacts Plans, Assessments, Studies Impact Study	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	The Potential Impacts of Climate Change on the Mid‐Atlantic Region	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Pennsylvania State University, University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science, y, George Mason University, Rutgers University, Delaware Center for the Inland Bays, Boston University, and EPA. 	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.int-res.com/articles/cr/14/c014p219.pdf	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	\N	f

Reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases, referred to as “mitigation,” is a necessary component of the overall \r\nresponse to climate change, and can help avoid, reduce, or delay future impacts. however, this guide focuses on climate \r\nchange adaptation for estuaries and coastal areas because: 1) estuaries are highly and uniquely vulnerable to climate \r\nchange, 2) adaptation will be necessary to address impacts resulting from warming which is already unavoidable due to \r\npast and current emissions, and 3) adaptation can help reduce the long-term costs associated with climate change.

This tool consists of aprogrammed in a Microsoft Excel workbook; uses downscaled climate predictions provided by the Climate Wizard; requires knowledge about current distribution and natural history of the species being assessed; predicts whether a species will decline, remain stable, or increase in numbers or distribution within an assessment area; identifies key factors associated with vulnerability for assessed species; and is complementary to NatureServe Conservation Status Ranks (assessment factors do not overlap). The Index uses a scoring system that integrates a species’ predicted exposure to climate change within an assessment area and three sets of factors associated with climate change sensitivity, each supported by published studies: 1) indirect exposure to climate change, 2) species specific factors (including dispersal ability, temperature and precipitation sensitivity, physical habitat specificity, interspecific interactions, and genetic factors), and 3) documented response to climate change.	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Completed Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic Virginia Biota Marine Endangered, Threatened, or Protected Species Terrestrial Candidate Species Species of Concern Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Risk Assessments Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Plans, Assessments, Studies Risk and Vulnerability	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	Applying the NatureServe Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment to Natural Heritage Resources in Virginia	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation – Division of Natural Heritage	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

Heritage also ran the G1 to G3 plants in the state through the CCVI.  In addition, they used Manomet's (Hector Galbraith's) non-coastal habitat vulnerability assessment model for its ecolofical communities. Both processes and results were peer-reviewed.  For the coastal species and habitats, Heritage is assessing Tier 1 and Tier 2 sites in the Action Plan and looking at where the sites fall in terms of a range of sea-level rise scenarios (0-2, 2-5. 5-10 feet).  This helps determine which sites and species located there might be influenced by sea-level rise. This information will be used in the update of the Wildlife Action Plan due to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 2015; however, the approach taken to integrate this information has not yet been determined.  \r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Ongoing Completed Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic Marlyland Natural Ecosystems Estuaries Biota Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Evaluation of Climate Change Tools and Data Social Impacts (Health and Public Security), Projects “retrofitted” for climate change, Adaptation/ Climate-Smart Planning	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	Maryland State Wildlife Action Plan Update	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	t	Maryland DNR Division of Wildlife and Heritage	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

The Roadmap is a community‐driven process, and will capitalize on existing and emerging partnerships, data, information, expertise and engagement. The NOAA Roadmap project will expand capacity in Newfields to respond to climate preparedness through (1) increased knowledge about vulnerabilities of community assets (2) awareness of climate adaptation options. The NOAA Roadmap process will also help to implement community-driven actions that facilitate integrating climate adaptation strategies into their existing plans, policies and practices. It is planned to collaborate with NH CAW in this project. Following this pilot project to adapt the NOAA Roadmap for a small NH coastal watershed community, the NH Natural Resources Outreach Coalition (NROC) and the NH Coastal Adaptation Workgroup (CAW) will seek to transfer the process to other small NH coastal watershed communities.	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	 Ongoing Regional Or State New England New Hampshire Public Health and Safety Infrastructure Managed Ecosystems Natural Ecosystems Recreation and Tourism Economic Resources Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Translation of Climate Science for Sector/Decision-Maker Use  Collaborative Stakeholder Engagements, adaptation planning	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	Navigating from Concern to Action Using the NOAA Roadmap in New Hampshire’s Small Coastal Communities	f	t	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	t	UNH	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	t	f	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

This information will allow marsh managers to understand the potential outcomes of sea level rise and adapt their management techniques. Correlating longterm wetland sedimentation rates to current wetland elevation will enable a detailed analysis of the potential sedimentation deficits that exist within the impoundments, as compared to the reference wetlands.

DFW is developing two climate-smart projects that will address the effects of sea-level on coastal impoundments.  One project will repair a dyke in a coastal impoundment and restore a tidal wetland buffer on the seaward side of the impoundment.  This project will help DFW maintain the impoundment in the short-term while enabling staff to monitor the effects of sea-level rise on the impoundment and plan longer-term management options.  The second pilot project will create an upland impoundment as an alternative for an existing coastal impoundment that might need to be abandoned if sea levels continue to rise. These projects are also part of a broader strategy to prolong the life of DFW coastal impoundments or replace their associated functions, and directly supports an America’s Great Outdoors initiative, the Delaware Bayshore Initiative.	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Planned Ongoing Climate-change Specific Projects Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Regional Or State Delaware Natural Ecosystems Biota Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	Protecting Delaware’s Coastal Impoundments from Sea Level Rise	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	t	Delaware Division of Fish and Wildlife	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.nwf.org/Global-Warming/Climate-Smart-Conservation/Adaptation-on-the-Ground/Northeast-Projects.aspx\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

Data collected using SETs can be used to determine both the influence of a single meteorological event on sediment surface elevation and a long-term trend in elevation change.  This information will help increase our understanding of sedimentation rates in different marshes, sea level rise effects in these marshes, and potential management techniques.  This study will result in a written report that includes a summary of results, discussion of data  analysis and statistical procedures. Results can then be used to determine both the influence of a single meteorological event on sediment surface elevation and a long-term trend (i.e. decades) in elevation change, as well as make predictions for future elevation changes in our local marshes.	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Ongoing Monitoring Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic Virginia Delaware Natural Ecosystems Assess Climate and its Impacts Monitor for Climate Impacts	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	t	Delaware Sediment Elevation Tables	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	t	DNREC Delaware Coastal Programs, DNREC Watershed Assessment, US Fish and Wildlife Service (Coastal Delaware Refuge Complex), Center for the Inland Bays	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.dnrec.delaware.gov/coastal/Documents/SeaLevelRise/SLRCompSept2011.pdf	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

Coordination of their activities and the operation under the existing decrees is provided by the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC). While much progress on improving the release rules has been made since 2006, we have identified a number of unresolved issues which deserve analytic attention, and for which we are confident that quantitatively based recommendations can be generated and offered for consideration to the stakeholders by the Delaware River Basin Commission.	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	 Ongoing Climate Impacts on Water Resources Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic New York Economic Resources Infrastructure Managed Ecosystems	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	Water Sustainability and the Environment under a Changing Climate: Promoting Adaptive Management in the Delaware River Basin	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	\N	f	f	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	\N	f

Given their ability to explicitly quantify the process model and parameter uncertainty through each estimation stage, Bayesian methods can be employed to better represent model and estimation uncertainties and indeed to find ways to reduce them by appropriate shrinking across spatial instances. In this project, we developed various Hierarchical Bayesian statistical techniques for reconstructing Delaware River flows using paleoclimatic information such as tree rings. This analysis will serve as the necessary building block for simulating water system operation and to provide a more objective evaluation of operating rules for reservoir systems consider changing conditions. The reconstructions also provided insights in to the probability of severe sustained droughts in this region.	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	 Research Research Climate Impacts on Water Resources Changes in Extremes of Weather and Climate Regional Or State Natural Ecosystems Managed Ecosystems Infrastructure Fresh Water Resources	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	Delaware River Streamflow Reconstruction Using Tree Rings	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	Development of statistical techniques for reconstructing flood and drought events on river systems	f	f	f	NOAA Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessments	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	\N	f

Critically, these plans draw upon a diverse set of understandings and meanings for what constitutes risk and vulnerability. The governments’ reports and policy documents illustrate a range of approaches to assessing, quantifying and addressing climate‐ related risks and the most vulnerable populations. This paper provides a comparative analysis of the conceptual and practical approaches of the states and cities to climate risk and vulnerability. The analysis draws on publicly available documents from Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. In order to fill some of the gaps identified in integrating climate vulnerability into planning, the paper also briefly explores the landscape of tools for and approaches to assessing climate vulnerability and risk, and the resources available to help planners integrate these factors into policy and action.	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Ongoing Climate-change Specific Projects Regional Or State Cross Disciplinary Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	Planning for climate vulnerability in the Urban Northeast: A review of state and local-level planning and the use of climate risk and vulnerability methodologies and tools	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	Paper presenting gap analysis on risk and vulnerability in climate change planning within project area	f	f	t	NOAA Climate Program Office, Climate and Societal Interactions (CSI)	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://cpo.noaa.gov/ClimatePrograms/ClimateSocietalInteractionsCSI/RISAProgram/FundedProjects.aspx?udt_1267_param_page=14&udt_1267_param_search=	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

Specifically, Manomet, NWF, and NEAFWA have embarked on a three-year effort to evaluate the vulnerabilities of the northeast’s key habitats and species, and to help increase the capabilities of state fish and wildlife agencies to respond to these challenges. This regional effort is the first of its kind in the country and is an essential step toward the implementation of effective “climate-smart” conservation of ecosystems.\r\n\r\nClimate change is already impacting ecological resources in North America, including fish and wildlife and their habitats. These effects will become more serious and widespread as the climate continues to change, and will pose major conservation and management challenges.  The overarching goal of the project is to provide vulnerability and adaptation information that will help the northeastern states to plan their conservation of fish and wildlife under a changing climate.  The results will be an essential step forward in effective regional climate change conservation planning. This project has five specific objectives:\r\n\r\n1. To quantify the vulnerabilities to climate change of fish and wildlife and their habitats across the region and thereby identify those habitats and species that are likely to be more or less vulnerable, and how these vulnerabilities vary spatially.\r\n\r\n2. To project how these habitats and species will change their status and distributions under climate change.\r\n\r\n3. To identify potential adaptation options (including the mitigation of non-climate stressors) that can be used to safeguard vulnerable habitats and species.\r\n\r\n4. To identify monitoring strategies that will help track the onset of climate change and the success, or otherwise, of adaptation actions.\r\n\r\n5. To work with states to increase their institutional knowledge and capabilities to respond to climate change through educational and planning workshops and other events.	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Ongoing Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Changes in Extremes of Weather and Climate Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Regional Or State New England Maine New Hampshire Massachusetts Vermont Connecticut Rhode Island Mid-Atlantic New York New Jersey Marlyland Pennsylvania Delaware Virginia Natural Ecosystems Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Climate-change Specific Projects	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	Evaluating the Vulnerabilities of Ecological Resources to Climate Change in the Northeast	f	t	f	f	t	t	t	t	f	f	f	\N	f	f	t	Manomet Center for Conservation Sciences; National Wildlife Federation, Northeast Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://rcngrants.org/content/assessing-likely-impacts-climate-change-northeastern-fish-and-wildlife-habitats-and-species\r\n	f	t	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

There are numerous efforts underway to identify marine habitats of importance to marine birds in the offshore environments of the eastern U.S. Many of these efforts are gathering similar types of information (i.e., baseline data) but are focusing on different regions and using different technologies. This project will bring together a unique partnership to pull together data from a variety of sources, including ships of opportunity, aerial surveys, species-specific telemetry studies, and the historic (from the 1970s to present) marine bird database (Atlantic Seabird Compendium) maintained by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).  These data will be used to model distribution and abundance patterns of many species or species groups of seabirds and then combine them with species risk assessments to create a spatially explicit risk surface.  The resulting “best bird map” can be used for informing decisions about siting offshore activities such as wind turbine installations, marine spatial planning efforts, or other uses requiring maps of seabird distributions such as identifying marine protected areas. The goal of this effort is to document and predict areas of frequent use and aggregations of birds and the relative risk to marine birds within these areas. The resulting risk surface can be used to inform offshore energy development and, more generally, marine spatial planning efforts about the importance of the pelagic habitats to marine birds.\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	 Ongoing Climate-change Specific Projects Research Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Regional Or State New England Mid-Atlantic Infrastructure Managed Ecosystems Natural Ecosystems Biota, visualization tools, web based tool	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	Mapping the Distribution, Abundance and Risk Assessment of Marine Birds in the Northwest Atlantic: Phase 1\r\n	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	t	U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, North Atlantic Landscape Conservation Cooperative, and Northwestern Atlantic Marine Bird Conservation Cooperative \r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.northatlanticlcc.org/projects.html\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

Populations have declined by 85% in the Northeast since 1992 and have reached dangerously low levels.  Black Rails now breed in only a dozen or fewer locations per state within its breeding range.  It is unlikely that Black Rails will persist in the Northeast without timely and appropriate conservation actions.  Funds from this grant will be used to partially support the creation of a Status Assessment and Conservation Action Plan for the Black Rail across the Northeast planning region.  Specifically, the funds will partially support a project facilitator that will provide the value-added synthesis for information resources gathered, facilitate the collection of information from an established consortium of agencies, biologists, academic institutions, and land managers of the Eastern Black Rail Conservation and Management Working Group and to construct the action items needed for a successful conservation campaign.   The funds will also support a workshop for members of the working group and other interested persons to take an active part in creating the documents.  Final products include a Status Assessment report, Conservation Action Plan report, and associated geo-referenced databases on status, distribution, and spatially explicit conservation priorities.  We feel that these products are the necessary steps to secure the future of a declining Black Rail population within the coastal portions New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia.\r\n\r\nWe envision the project work in two distinct phases.  Phase 1 includes the completion of a Status Assessment document and associated geo-referenced databases used for support of the assessment.  Phase 2 is the completion of a Conservation Action Plan that synthesizes information gathered from Phase 1 into meaningful conservation approaches to halt and reverse population declines of Black Rails.  A workshop for each Phase is planned for Northeastern work group members and other interested persons.   We envision this project will take two years from initiation to complete.  Phase 1 is estimated to be finished in one year and Phase 2 one additional year.  We are already undertaking this effort without a primary funding source so the initial framework for interagency communication, document outlines, and database structures are already being developed.  We will orchestrate a Black Rail status assessment workshop within the first quarter of the Phase 1 funding cycle.  The Conservation Action Plan of Phase 2 will be completed within one year and only begin after Phase 1 is completed.\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Ongoing Climate-change Specific Projects Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic New York Pennsylvania New Jersey Marlyland Delaware Virginia Natural Ecosystems Biota Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	Support for Status Assessment and Conservation Action Plan for the Eastern Black Rail across the Northeast Region\r\n	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	\N	f	f	t	Center for Conservation Biology, College of William and Mary and Virginia; Northeast Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies \r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://rcngrants.org/content/support-status-assessment-and-conservation-action-plan-eastern-black-rail-across-northeast\r\n	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

As a result, there is a pressing need to understand how sea level rise may affect coastal marshes and a variety of associated obligate vertebrate species. This project will address aspects of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s (FWS) Strategic Habitat Conservation (SHC) initiative by linking landscape [marsh] response to sea level rise with habitat relationship models for a variety of wildlife species.  First, we intend to develop hierarchical models of animal survey data that assess the importance of local biophysical factors with respect to animal distribution and abundance.  These models will then be linked to outputs from models simulating the response of intertidal wetland complexes in the northeast to predicted sea level rise. We will also evaluate the uncertainty surrounding predictions from "downscaled" projections, and whether available data on species habitat relationships are sufficient for meaningful predictions of future species-habitat relationships. Anticipated products will allow the Service and its partners to strategically plan future conservation efforts and sustain populations of priority species. \r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Ongoing Climate-change Specific Projects Research Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Regional Or State New England Mid-Atlantic Natural Ecosystems Biota Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Assess Climate and its Impacts Forecasts of Climate Impacts 	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	Coastal Wetland Dynamics and Wildlife Populations: Modeling the Effects of Sea Level Rise and Landscape Change\r\n	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	t	USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/MissionAreas/ClimateLand/WetlandDynamics.pdf; http://www.theglobalchangeforum.org/se-csc/usgs-south-atlantic-lcc-funded-projects/\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

To meet this goal, we are developing a Landscape Change, Assessment and Design (LCAD) model for the NALCC, as described in the documents below.\r\nPhase one of this project, which began in December 2010 and was completed June 2012, focused on developing the overall modeling framework for simulating landscape change and assessing the ecological consequences of those changes (i.e., landscape change and assessment), and piloting the model in three study landscapes: 1) Kennebec River watershed in Maine, 2) middle Connecticut River watershed in Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont, and 3) combined Pocomoke and Nanticoke River watersheds in Maryland and Deleware. \r\nPhase two of this project, which began in July 2012 and will continue through June 2014, will focus on extending the landscape modeling to the entire Northeast (13 states), modeling an additional 20 representative species, expanding the ecological integrity assessment, coupling the landscape change model with a third party sea level rise model, improving the vegetation succession modeling, and developing an approach for integrating the results of the landscape change assessment into decision support for landscape design.\r\nThis project website provides links to recent presentations, results of phase 1 including a report and accompanying data for each of the pilot watersheds, detailed working technical documentation, and an online manager survey to provide feedback. \r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	 Ongoing Climate-change Specific Projects Research Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Changes in Extremes of Weather and Climate Regional Or State New England Maine New Hampshire Massachusetts Vermont Mid-Atlantic Marlyland Delaware Infrastructure Natural Ecosystems Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Forecasts of Climate Conditions Forecasts of Climate Impacts  Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	t	f	t	f	t	f	f	Assessment of Landscape Changes in the North Atlantic Landscape Conservation Cooperative: Decision-Support Tools for Conservation\r\n	f	t	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	t	Department of Environmental Conservation, University of Massachusetts\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.northatlanticlcc.org/projects.html	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

Some evidence suggests that existing HHWS, early warning combined with actions to assist vulnerable populations, are saving lives, but the evidence is insufficient to guide the design of effective HHWS. We will conduct a comparative assessment of the major HHWS in the highly urbanized northeast. We will compare detailed evidence about the institutional structures of the three HHWS in order to understand which components are effective in saving lives and why, and what other cities can learn about how to reduce mortality and morbidity from heat waves under different climatic and socio-economic conditions.

Several commonalities already exist between the two schemes; namely each has a multi-scale hierarchical framework, relies on structural environmental features, and seeks to convey physical-biological linkages. Making CMECS and NRHCS compatible will bring appropriate specificity to the application of the national CMECS standard to the region. Coordination will take place between state, academic, and non-profit partners and existing ocean partnerships (NROC and MARCO) to identify and cross-walk existing state marine classification systems. The scalability of this classification will be examined by conducting pilot mapping projects at three different scales relevant to planning and conservation efforts. At the smallest scale (1:5,000,000), the classification will be applied to the Nature Conservancy’s 2010 Northwest Atlantic Marine Assessment. An intermediate-scale classification (1:250,000) will utilize datasets assembled for marine spatial planning efforts in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and adjacent federal waters. Finally, estuary-specific, high-resolution information for Boston Harbor (1:5,000 scale) will be classified. These pilots will allow  assessment of the ability of CMECS to convey consistent ecological data across relevant scales. Workshops and phone meetings will happen in the first year followed by the pilot efforts in the second year.  \r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Ongoing Regional Or State New England Mid-Atlantic Research Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Natural Ecosystems Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	Northeast Regional Coastal and Marine Ecological Classification Standard\r\n	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	t	The Nature Conservancy\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.northatlanticlcc.org/projects.html\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

Piping plovers (Charadrius melodus) respond rapidly to change and depend on these low-lying coastal areas throughout their life cycle, making them excellent indicators of climate change effects. This project will develop predictions of how piping plover breeding habitat will change as a result of sea level rise and altered storminess, using a coupled risk-assessment model. The first portion of the model assesses changes to coastal geomorphology using dynamic sea level rise predictions and is linked to the second portion of the model that assesses plover habitat selection. The first task will utilize the vast data sets documenting plover habitat preference for, and utilization of, topographic, hydrodynamic, and vegetation regimes. This task will develop a plover model that is quantitatively tied to measurable physical variables including elevation, slope, frequency of inundation and overwash, and amount of vegetation. Future scenarios will be modeled in order to analyze the efficacy of existing and alternate conservation strategies against plausible sea level and other future climate variables.\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Ongoing Climate-change Specific Projects Research Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Regional Or State Natural Ecosystems Biota Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Forecasts of Climate Conditions Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	Forecast Effects of Sea level Rise on Habitat of Piping Plovers and Identify Responsive Conservation Strategies\r\n	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	t	Virginia Tech; North Atlantic Landscape Conservation Cooperative	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.northatlanticlcc.org/projects.html\r\n	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

This research effort investigates the impact of changes to precipitation and temperature on the hydrology of urban spaces and the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems connected to them directly or indirectly through infrastructure. Specifically, we are investigating relationships between climatological conditions and water/wastewater/stormwater infrastructure, with a focus on a) impacts of climate conditions on water and wastewater treatment plant performance, b) how varying levels of climatically impacted infrastructure performance relate to various indicators of public health and c) the use of various green infrastructure (GI) strategies as a climate change adaptation strategy (through its role in reducing the energy and GHG emissions associated with less stormwater and enhanced urban evapotranspiration).	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	 Ongoing Climate-change Specific Projects Research Climate Impacts on Water Resources Regional Or State Infrastructure Fresh Water Resources Water Supply Wastewater Storm Water Public Health and Safety Water Quality	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	Climate Information for Water Harvesting and Re-use Strategies in Philadelphia	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	t	NOAA Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessments	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	t	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	t	f	f	\N	f

During this transition period, intense frontal rainfall can combine with seasonal snowmelt and dramatically increase flooding potential throughout the region. This project analyzes daily streamflow data from Northeast U.S. rivers to identify an ensemble of extreme of flooding events and the hydro-meteorological conditions that precede them. The climatology of the conditions leading to these extreme floods is determined by averaging key meteorological variables over all the identified events to determine what is common to all the events. Addressed is whether or not such conditions can be predicted at longer lead times than those associated with weather forecasting.	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Ongoing Research Climate Impacts on Water Resources Changes in Extremes of Weather and Climate Regional Or State Public Health and Safety Emergency Management	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	Hydro- Meteorological Conditions Associated with Extreme Flooding in the Northeast United States Rivers	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	Statistical analysis of primary hydro-meteorological factors associated with extreme floods in US Northeast large river basins.	f	f	t	NOAA Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessments	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	t	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	\N	f

This project is funded with State Wildlife Grant dollars and generous support from the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation.  It is designed to address one of the Data and Modeling Needs that was identified within our 2009 climate change adaptation strategy (page 19; http://www.bewildvirginia.org/climate-change/).  The project has two main research components: \r\n1.  Develop a regional climate model that can help inform wildlife management decisions and; 2.  Assess how the predicted changes are likely to impact species and habitats associated with Virginia’s Wildlife Action Plan.                                                      For the first component, a climatologist conducted a dynamic downscaling of the continental-scale climate models developed by the IPCC.  This allowed for about 45 different climate variables and increased the geographic resolution from 100 sq. km. to 10 sq. km.  The models include almost all of West Virginia, all of Virginia, all of Maryland, and all of Delaware.  Models were generated using the B1 and the A1FI green house gas emission scenarios and outputs were generated for the year 2060 (50 years from our start date) and the year 2095 (near the end of the IPCC model run).  For the second component, the climate change data was used to determined potential range shifts of a selection of Species of Greatest Conservation Need based on the climate variables most significant to a species survival.  All outputs are spatially explicit and depict potential species shifts based solely on climate variables at 2050 and 2095.	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Ongoing Research Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Changes in Extremes of Weather and Climate Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic Virginia Biota Terrestrial Endangered, Threatened, or Protected Species Natural Ecosystems Species of Concern Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Assess Climate and its Impacts Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	Vulnerability Assessment of Virginia's Species of Greatest Conservation Need	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	t	Department of Game and Inland Fisheries, National Wildlife Federation, Conservation Management Institute 	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

Coastal wetlands and abutting upland areas will be identified using recent LiDAR elevation data, existing digital Geographic Information System (GIS) data, and the Sea Level Affecting Marsh Model (SLAMM). The modeling will use sea level rise projections of 0.3, 1.0 and 1.5 meters to show short- and long-term scenarios projected for Rhode Island. The resulting outcomes will lead to revisions to Rhode Island coastal program policies and standards, new climate change adaptation strategies, and new standards for coastal buffer zones and coastal wetland restoration projects. Another potential tool is the establishment of rolling easements in order to protect these critical areas. The project will create a publicly accessible web-based mapping tool to help local and state planners and policy makers analyze potential community and ecosystem impacts from sea level rise. In addition, the research team will hold workshops to provide outreach education to coastal communities to assist in local community planning efforts. The Rhode Island project meets NOAA’s Next Generation Strategic Plan objectives – improving the tools and methods for assessing the susceptibility of coastal ecosystems to climate change, and using findings to inform decision-makers. Because many coastal states are faced with the same dilemma, this project and the lessons learned from it will be widely used and transferable to other states in the country, to assist in their efforts to protect and restore coastal wetlands nationwide."	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	 Climate-change Specific Projects Research Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Regional Or State New England Rhode Island Natural Ecosystems Coasts Infrastructure Built Coast (e.g., engineered solutions for shoreline protection) Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Translation of Climate Science for Sector/Decision-Maker Use  Provision of Guidance Documents	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	Development of Coastal Zone Management Tools and Strategies for Coastal Ecosystems Adaptation to Climate Change and Sea Level Rise	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	Rhode Island Coastal Resource Management Council, www.crmc.ri.gov 	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	www.crmc.ri.gov 	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

Specifically, the direct and indirect effects of ocean acidification will be examined within a simple, controlled predator/prey system containing a single prey phytoplankton species (the coccolithophore, Emiliania huxleyi) and a single predator (the oceanic metazoan grazer, Calanus finmarchicus). The experiments are designed to elucidate both direct effects (i.e. effects of ocean acidification on the individual organisms only) and interactive effects (i.e. effects on the combined predator/prey system). Interactive experiments with phytoplankton prey and zooplankton predator are a critical starting point for predicting the overall impact of ocean acidification in marine ecosystems. To meet these goals, a state-of-the-art facility will be constructed with growth chambers that are calibrated and have highly-controlled pH and alkalinity levels. The strength of this approach lies in meticulous calibration and redundant measurements that will be made to ensure that conditions within the chambers are well described and tightly monitored for DIC levels. Growth and calcification rates in coccolithophores and the developmental rates, morphological and behavioral effects on copepods will be measured. The PIC and POC in the algae and the excreted fecal pellets will be monitored for changes in the PIC/POC ratio, a key parameter for modeling feedback mechanisms for rising pCO2 levels. In addition, 14C experiments are planned to measure calcification rates in coccolithophores and dissolution rates as a result of grazing. These key experiments will verify closure in the mass balance of PIC, allowing the determination of actual dissolution rates of PIC within the guts of copepod grazers.\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	Ongoing Sustainability of Marine Ecosystems Regional Or State New England Maine New Hampshire Massachusetts Rhode Island Mid-Atlantic New York New Jersey Delaware Marlyland Natural Ecosystems Oceans Biota Marine	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	t	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	Ocean Acidification - Effects of Ocean Acidification on Emiliania huxleyi and Calanus finmarchicus; Insights Into the Oceanic Alkalinity and Biological Carbon Pumps	f	t	f	f	t	t	t	t	f	f	f	Product, Services	t	f	t	National Science Foundation (NSF) Division of Ocean Sciences (OCE) and Directorate for Geosciences (GEO); Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences, East Boothbay, ME	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1220068	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

The plan will also describe the distribution of marsh habitats and recommend areas for restoration and other soft erosion control methods, as well as identify splash points that may require more structural approaches to erosion control. The plan will also estimate long-term shoreline erosion rates as an aid to land-use planning and identify low-lying areas that are particularly susceptible to sea level increase and storm surge events. We will work with the USACE on developing approaches to minimize the loss of sediment from salt marsh habitat via commercial and recreational boating and AIWW maintenance dredging."	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	 Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Regional Or State South East North Carolina Infrastructure Built Coast (e.g., engineered solutions for shoreline protection) Natural Ecosystems Coasts	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	Shoreline Habitat Types and Erosion Rates on Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	Product	f	f	f	NOAA/NCCOS, Center for Coastal Fisheries and Habitat Research	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://coastalscience.noaa.gov/projects/detail?key=4	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

The model will connect biogeochemical, population, and economic information to create an integrated assessment model. The biogeochemical component will provide environmental data including ocean acidification trends that will feed into the population component in order to predict sea scallop harvest quantities. Sea scallop harvest quantities will drive the regional economic component in which scallop fishing and coastal zone policy decisions will affect the population and biogeochemical information. The integrated assessment model will be modular so that each component can be refined or replaced as new data and components become available. As a web-based interactive tool, the model will enhance decisions by providing managers with visual displays of outcomes based on different choices affecting scallop harvests, environmental conditions, and socioeconomic conditions."	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Ongoing Climate-change Specific Projects Sustainability of Marine Ecosystems Regional Or State New England Mid-Atlantic Managed Ecosystems Fisheries Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Translation of Climate Science for Sector/Decision-Maker Use  Maine New Hampshire Massachusetts Rhode Island New York New Jersey Marlyland Delaware	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	t	t	f	t	f	t	f	f	Ocean Acidification and Sea Scallops: Predicting Impacts of Climate Change	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	t	f	f	f	Product	f	f	t	NOAA National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS) Regional Ecosystem Prediction Program (REPP), NOAA Ocean Acidification Program	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	http://coastalscience.noaa.gov/projects/detail?key=101	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

In recent years, the team has adapted and developed quantitative proteomic capabilities for marine microbes using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry systems. The approach has become virtually routine and could be applied to a variety of problems related to ocean acidification. In addition, because of the climatic link between ocean acidification and global warming, the synergistic influences of increasing temperature will also be studied.	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Ongoing Climate-change Specific Projects Sustainability of Marine Ecosystems Regional Or State New England Mid-Atlantic South East Natural Ecosystems Oceans Biota Marine Assess Climate and its Impacts Experimental Impacts (single species and multi-species, physiology and ecology)	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	Ocean Acidification: The Influence of Ocean Acidification and Rising Temperature on Phytoplankton Proteome Composition	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	t	f	t	National Science Foundations (NSF), Division of Ocean Sciences (OCE), Directorate for Geosciences (GEO); Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, Woods Hole, MA	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1220484	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

These species are selected because they are commercially valuable,\r\nare especially vulnerable to ocean acidification, have different life histories, and show different sensitivities to ocean acidification. Population models will consider the survival, growth and reproduction of each species under various ocean acidification conditions.  Field surveys will be performed to measure ocean chemistry at different sites within Rhode Island and New York estuaries. This data will be combined with 100-yr carbon emission scenarios to assess impacts of ocean acidification. By modeling two species with contrasting life histories and ocean acidification susceptibilities combined with comprehensive mapping of water chemistry in estuaries, the resulting predictions will enhance development of adaptation and management plans for these and other bivalve fisheries, provide guidance on sustainable harvest levels, and identify regions of estuaries that are most vulnerable to extremes in acidification.\r\nAll information will be disseminated to regional shellfish and water quality managers through a workshop format.	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Ongoing Sustainability of Marine Ecosystems Regional Or State New England Rhode Island Mid-Atlantic New York Managed Ecosystems Fisheries Assess Climate and its Impacts Forecasts of Climate Impacts 	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	Predicting Impacts of Ocean Acidification on Northeast US Shellfish	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	Workshop	f	f	t	NOAA National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS) Regional Ecosystem Prediction Program (REPP), NOAA Ocean Acidification Program	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://coastalscience.noaa.gov/projects/detail?key=125	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

Foraminifera are an ideal organism for this work because they (1) are relatively small, allowing experimentation on statistically significant populations; (2) have both calcareous and non-calcareous representatives; (3) are relatively short-lived so experiments include a major portion of their life cycle; (4) include aerobes and anaerobes; and (5) provide a fossil record allowing comparisons across time. Laboratory culturing experiments will be used to determine the response of benthic foraminifera, in terms of survival and growth, to co-varying parameters of pH and oxygen, and to explore the influence of increased temperature on these responses. The researchers will examine the relative effects of higher pCO2, lower [O2], and higher temperature (T) on both calcareous and non-calcareous benthic foraminifera. In addition, they will examine the pre-Industrial benthic foraminiferal assemblage at the field site, and will compare that assemblage to those produced in the experiments under pre-Industrial (lower than current day) and elevated pCO2 levels. 	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Ongoing Sustainability of Marine Ecosystems National Regional Or State New England Maine New Hampshire Massachusetts Rhode Island Mid-Atlantic New York New Jersey Marlyland Delaware Virginia South East North Carolina South Carolina Managed Ecosystems Fisheries Natural Ecosystems Oceans Biota Marine Assess Climate and its Impacts	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	t	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	Ocean Acidification, Hypoxia and Warming: Experimental Investigations into Compounded Effects of Global Change on Benthic Foraminifera	t	t	f	f	t	t	t	t	f	t	f	Product	t	f	t	National Science Foundation (NSF) Division of Ocean Sciences (OCE), Directorate for Geosciences (GEO); Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Woods Hole, MA	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	\N	f	t	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1219948	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f
