The report is a detailed assessment of climate change for coastal New Hampshire that describes how the region's climate has changed over the past century, and how climate may change over the course of this century based on different global greenhouse gas emission scenarios. The impacts of our changing climate are already affecting coastal communities. This report provides decision-relevant information on a regional scale to individual, municipal, regional, and state decision-makers.  The information compiled in the climate assessment provides the foundation for developing local adaptation plans to a changing climate and this project will disseminate this information to seacoast municipalities. Adaptation can help reduce the vulnerability of both natural and social systems to climate change and variability, and can assist with preparing for and coping with negative impacts. Adapting to a changing climate requires both data and information at a spatial and temporal scale that is relevant to decision making. The information compiled in this climate change assessment report, combined with the NHCAW training programs, will provide the foundation for developing local adaptation planning to a changing climate.\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Completed Regional Or State New England New Hampshire Climate Impacts on Water Resources Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Translation of Climate Science for Sector/Decision-Maker Use  Physical Atmospheric Coastal and Oceanic Terrestrial (Groundwater, Soil Moisture, surface water, glaciers and ice caps, land cover, biomass) Climate Society Interactions Plans, Assessments, Studies Impact Study Risk and Vulnerability	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	Assessment of Climate Change in Coastal New Hampshire	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	Provide decision-relevant information on a regional scale to individual, municipal, regional, and state decision-makers information to assist in adaptation efforts.

The Division also used the SLAMM results to look at where future nesting areas might be located and whether there was development nearby or if they could be protected.  SLAMM predicts a decrease of sandy areas with sea-level rise, but one conculsion is that Poplar Island restoration has resulted in an increase in terrapin sandy beach habitat. Thus, this shows that if the Division can stay out ahead of sea-level rise they might be able to restore or create terrapin habitat than will not be affected by sea-level rise.   	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	 Completed Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic Marlyland Natural Ecosystems Inland Habitats and Watersheds  Beaches Biota Marine Terrestrial Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Ecological and Biological	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	Terrapin Nesting Habitat and Sea-Level Rise	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Maryland Division of Wildlife and Heritage	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

The objective is to identify and map high priority, currently upland areas suitable for salt marsh migration and reestablishment. The strategy will also identify opportunities to increase resilience to sea level rise and slow the rate of loss to open water of current ecologically valuable marshes. Both the Assessment and Strategy will be developed based on a synthesis of available information and will result in implementation activities to both protect priority lands in the county as well as engage in restoration and management activities to conserve marshes. Economic considerations regarding use of the landscape for conservation, recreation, agriculture, forestry and development will be factored in to the best of our ability. The strategic plan will be used to plan to use the strategic Assessment to: Identify appropriate land protection and management strategies for facilitating salt marsh migration as sea levels rise; Identify the most suitable locations in the project area for designation as marsh migration corridors where management should focus on providing the greatest possible contiguous extent of salt marsh through the 21st century under a 1.03m sea level rise scenario; Identify priority land parcels that should be conserved for potential marsh migration corridors; Recommend best management practices (BMPs) for facilitating salt marsh establishment on newly tidal lands and prioritize locations to apply BMPs to create new high marsh habitat for threatened salt marsh birds;\r\nRecommend which potential barriers to marsh migration should be removed or mitigated. Develop policies for barrier removal/mitigation and for preventing the creation of new barriers, e.g., physical defenses against sea level rise; and Identify strategies and/or areas for marsh restoration and management, including evaluating the feasibility of restoring marshes through adding sediment, and determining BMPs and locations for improving existing marsh habitat for salt marsh birds."	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	 Ongoing Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic Marlyland Forests Coasts Inland Habitats and Watersheds  Wetlands (e.g., saltwater, brackish, freshwater; tidal/non-tidal) Natural Ecosystems Managed Ecosystems Biota Assess Climate and its Impacts Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Improve Scientific Understanding of the Climate System and Essential Climate Variables Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	Maryland Backwater Inland	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	t	f	Maryland Audubon and The Conservation Fund\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f

The report focuses specifically on sea-level rise and coastal storms. The Phase I Strategy is a key component of the Maryland Climate Action Plan, detailing the actions necessary to protect Maryland's future economic well-being, environmental heritage and public safety in the face of climate change and sea level rise. This report lays out the specific priority policy recommendations of the ARWG to address short-and long-term adaptation and response measures, planning and policy integration, education and outreach, performance measurement, and, where necessary, new legislation and/or modifications to existing laws.

Knowing this relationship will help predict when    flooding and splash-over events (such as beach erosion) might occur based on forecast water level (tide height) and wave height data. Working with the National Weather Service in Gray, Maine, NERACOOS and modelers in the Northeast region, a working prototype was developed using a water level model (NECOFS/FVCOM) and wave model (Wave Watch 3). This prototype is currently working for Hampton, New Hampshire and Scituate, Massachusetts locations. We hope to expand to other regions depending on need. For more information on how to read the nomogram, click here. This product could be used by emergency managers, coastal homeowners and other users with interest and concern about beach erosion from large-wave storms. During the Patriot's Day Storm, there were four high-tide cycles in which the water level was near or above flood stage and the waves were greater than 20' in height. This combination caused the tremendous amounts of coastal damage seen during the storm. The Coastal Flooding and Erosion Forecast System actually predicted days in advance of the Patriot's Day Storm that there was a high likelihood of this damage occurring. This capacity is extremely important to coastal property owners and emergency responders, resulting in dollars and lives saved. 	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Completed Regional Or State New England New Hampshire Public Health and Safety Emergency Management Infrastructure Climate Impacts on Water Resources Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Coastal and Oceanic Physical Forecasts and outlooks (monthly to annual, models)  Risk and Vulnerability	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	Coastal Flooding and Erosion Forecast\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	Develop a working prototype that demonstrates the empirical relationship exists between storm tide, waves and coastal flooding or splash-over damage to help predict when    flooding and splash-over events (such as beach erosion) might occur.	f	f	f	f	f	Piscataqua Region Estuary Partnership (PREP)	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	\N	f

The effects anticipated under various sea level rise scenarios include those associated with coastal storm flooding, both intensity and frequency, and those associated with more gradual changes in groundwater levels and  drainage.  The vulnerability assessment describes some of the associated problems that may occur, with particular emphasis on the effects related to coastal flooding.   The recommendations address suggested modifications to the County’s planning and regulatory mechanism, including the Floodplain Management Ordinance/Building Code, Zoning Ordinance, Subdivision Regulations, Comprehensive Plan, and Hazard Mitigation Plan.  	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Completed Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic Marlyland Local/City  Public Health and Safety Infrastructure Managed Ecosystems Natural Ecosystems Economic Resources Changes in Extremes of Weather and Climate Improve Scientific Understanding of the Climate System and Essential Climate Variables Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Maps (Imagery, geo-referenced data) Plans, Assessments, Studies Adaptation/Action Plan Management Guidance (i.e. structured decision making)	f	f	t	f	f	t	t	t	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	Somerset County, Maryland: Rising Sea Level Guidance	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Somerset County	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.dnr.state.md.us/dnrnews/pdfs/SomersetSLRGuidance.pdf	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

In addition, they used Manomet's (Hector Galbraith's) non-coastal habitat vulnerability assessment model for its ecolofical communities. Both processes and results were peer-reviewed.  For the coastal species and habitats, Heritage is assessing Tier 1 and Tier 2 sites in the Action Plan and looking at where the sites fall in terms of a range of sea-level rise scenarios (0-2, 2-5. 5-10 feet).  This helps determine which sites and species located there might be influenced by sea-level rise. This information will be used in the update of the Wildlife Action Plan due to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 2015; however, the approach taken to integrate this information has not yet been determined.  	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Ongoing Completed Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic Marlyland Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Natural Ecosystems Biota Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Translation of Climate Science for Sector/Decision-Maker Use 	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	Maryland State Wildlife Action Plan Update	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	t	f	Maryland DNR Division of Wildlife and Heritage	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

Sea level has risen approximately one foot in the last century and is expected to rise another 2 - 3 feet by the year 2100. Sea level rise impacts coastal areas by exacerbating coastal flooding, influencing shoreline erosion, and submerging tidal wetlands and other low-lying lands. Such impacts pose a significant threat to the steep cliffs, wetlands and marshes, tidal estuaries, and sandy beaches, and barrier islands that comprise Maryland's coastal environment. Recognizing the need to begin planning for sea level rise, a NOAA Coastal Management Fellow with Maryland's Coastal Program developed a Sea Level Rise Response Strategy for the State of Maryland. The strategy sets forth the policy and implementation framework for reducing the State's overall vulnerability to sea level rise in the coming years.	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Completed Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic Marlyland Natural Ecosystems Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Improve Scientific Understanding of the Climate System and Essential Climate Variables Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Translate Climate Science for the Public  Promote Public Climate Literacy Hindcasts (climatologies, models) Forecasts and outlooks (monthly to annual, models)  Plans, Assessments, Studies Adaptation/Action Plan Adaptation/Action Plan Risk and Vulnerability Engagement Management Guidance (i.e. structured decision making) Regulatory/ Policy Guidance	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	A Sea Level Rise Response Strategy for the State of Maryland	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Maryland Department of Natural Resources 	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.dnr.state.md.us/bay/czm/sea_level_rise.html	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

The CVI ranks the following in terms of their physical \r\ncontribution to sea-level rise-related coastal change: geomorphology, regional coastal slope, rate of relative sea-level rise, shoreline change rates, mean tidal range and mean wave height. Rankings for each variable were combined and an index value calculated for 1-minute grid cells covering the park. The CVI highlights those regions where the physical effects of sea-level rise might be the greatest. This approach combines the coastal system's susceptibility to change with its natural ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions, yielding a quantitative, although relative, measure of the park's natural vulnerability to the effects of sea-level rise.  The CVI provides an objective technique for evaluation and long-term planning by scientists and park managers. Assateague Island consists of stable and washover dominated portions of barrier beach backed by wetland and marsh. The areas within Assateague that are likely to be most vulnerable to sea-level rise are those with the highest occurrence of overwash and the highest rates of shoreline change."	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Completed Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic Virginia Natural Ecosystems Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Forecasts of Climate Conditions Forecasts of Climate Impacts  Translation of Climate Science for Sector/Decision-Maker Use  Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Physical Coastal and Oceanic Surface (Sea-surface temperature, sea level, salinity, ocean color, wave height) Projections (intra-annual to multi-decadal, including SLR and model down-scaling) Maps (Imagery, geo-referenced data) Plans, Assessments, Studies Risk and Vulnerability	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	COASTAL VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT OF ASSATEAGUE ISLAND NATIONAL SEASHORE(ASIS) TO SEA-LEVEL RISE\r\n	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	U.S. Geological Society\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2004/1020/images/pdf/asis.pdf) \r\n	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

This project is funded with State Wildlife Grant dollars and generous support from the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation.  It is designed to address one of the Data and Modeling Needs that was identified within our 2009 climate change adaptation strategy (page 19; http://www.bewildvirginia.org/climate-change/).  The project has two main research components: \r\n1.  Develop a regional climate model that can help inform wildlife management decisions and; 2.  Assess how the predicted changes are likely to impact species and habitats associated with Virginia’s Wildlife Action Plan.                                                      For the first component, a climatologist conducted a dynamic downscaling of the continental-scale climate models developed by the IPCC.  This allowed for about 45 different climate variables and increased the geographic resolution from 100 sq. km. to 10 sq. km.  The models include almost all of West Virginia, all of Virginia, all of Maryland, and all of Delaware.  Models were generated using the B1 and the A1FI green house gas emission scenarios and outputs were generated for the year 2060 (50 years from our start date) and the year 2095 (near the end of the IPCC model run).  For the second component, the climate change data was used to determined potential range shifts of a selection of Species of Greatest Conservation Need based on the climate variables most significant to a species survival.  All outputs are spatially explicit and depict potential species shifts based solely on climate variables at 2050 and 2095.	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Ongoing Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic Virginia Natural Ecosystems Biota Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Downscale Climate Models Forecasts of Climate Impacts  Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Atmospheric Physical Surface (air temperature, precipitation, wind) Upper-air  Composition Terrestrial (Groundwater, Soil Moisture, surface water, glaciers and ice caps, land cover, biomass) Ecological and Biological In situ Observations Other Plans, Assessments, Studies Risk and Vulnerability, research	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	Vulnerability Assessment of Virginia's Species of Greatest Conservation Need\r\n	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	t	f	Department of Game and Inland Fisheries, National Wildlife Federation, Conservation Management Institute 	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	\N	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

This tool consists of aprogrammed in a Microsoft Excel workbook; uses downscaled climate predictions provided by the Climate Wizard; requires knowledge about current distribution and natural history of the species being assessed; predicts whether a species will decline, remain stable, or increase in numbers or distribution within an assessment area; identifies key factors associated with vulnerability for assessed species; and is complementary to NatureServe Conservation Status Ranks (assessment factors do not overlap). The Index uses a scoring system that integrates a species’ predicted exposure to climate change within an assessment area and three sets of factors associated with climate change sensitivity, each supported by published studies: 1) indirect exposure to climate change, 2) species specific factors (including dispersal ability, temperature and precipitation sensitivity, physical habitat specificity, interspecific interactions, and genetic factors), and 3) documented response to climate change.	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Completed Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic Virginia Biota Marine Endangered, Threatened, or Protected Species Terrestrial Candidate Species Species of Concern Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Risk Assessments Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Plans, Assessments, Studies Risk and Vulnerability	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	Applying the NatureServe Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment to Natural Heritage Resources in Virginia	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation – Division of Natural Heritage	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

The product of this working group—The Yale Framework—assists conservation planners in selecting the assessment and modeling strategies that are most relevant to their specific needs. Rather than supplanting existing techniques, the Yale Framework provides simplified and flexible advice on models and data, and presents a list of commonly used datasets that can be helpful to planners. The Framework also provides a structured menu of options that assist resource managers in determining the best possible approach to conservation, as opposed to offering a prescriptive approach to natural resource management. The Yale Mapping Framework has been built using the Data Basin platform. Data Basin makes it simple to find reliable data and make compelling visualizations. Planners can locate datasets, combine multiple layers together in a visualization session, and then share maps with their colleagues. With the Data Basin data and tools, planners have everything they need to make their assessments.\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Ongoing National Natural Ecosystems Biota Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Translation of Climate Science for Sector/Decision-Maker Use  Evaluation of Climate Change Tools and Data Training and Capacity Building Data Support tools (help using specific data products) Adaptation and Mitigation Guidance, including Best Practices Manuals, Toolkits, and Guides Viewers and Web-based Tools Monitoring tools (e.g. U.S. Drought Monitor) Visualization tools (web-based, mapping programs) Prioritization Tools Management Guidance (i.e. structured decision making)	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	The Yale Mapping Framework for Integrating Climate Adaptatin and Landscape Conservation Planning\r\n	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	t	f	Yale University, School of Forestry & Environmental Studies\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	http://www.databasin.org/yale\r\n	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

This assessment provided a pilot to support a larger project focused on developing a handbook for integrating Climate Change Adaptation into CCP revisions at National Wildlife Refuges.  In this assessment, potential implications of salt- water inundation and habitat loss from SLR and increased storm surge elevations, as well as change in ecosystem/habitat composition due to changes in land use and land cover (i.e. conversion from natural conditions) were modeled to estimate responses by priority resources.  Focus was placed on biological and infrastructure resources of critical importance.  Biological resources included rare species populations and mapped habitat of known importance for migratory bird species and monarch butterflies, while infrastructure resources included structures and infrastructure necessary for the recreational and educational missions of the Refuge Complex (e.g. kiosks, roadways, visitor center).  Spatial input data were most accessible and accurate for the Refuge Complex proper, and modeling outputs were most informative there as well.  However, the study area included the entirety of the Virginia Eastern Shore (i.e. supporting landscape).  Using NatureServe Vista, an ArcGIS extension Decision Support Tool, scenarios were modeled for timesteps of 2025, 2050, 2075 and 2100.  Outputs included tabular and map summaries of predicted changes in available habitat for priority biological and infrastructure resources.  	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Completed Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic Virginia Infrastructure Managed Ecosystems Natural Ecosystems Biota Social and Cultural Resources Recreation and Tourism Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Plans, Assessments, Studies Risk and Vulnerability	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	ESVaNWR Resource Vulnerability Assessment: RESOURCE VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT AND STRATEGIES FOR MANAGEMENT OPTIONS FOR THE EASTERN SHORE OF VIRGINIA AND FISHERMAN ISLAND NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGES\r\n	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation – Division of Natural Heritage and NatureServe\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	t	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

The ultimate goal of the project is to have definitive actions that result in coastal communities being more resilient to climate variability. In Maine this included a survey and focus groups of property owners, municipal officials, and recreationists to determine "barriers and benefits that coastal property owners and municipal officials face in taking action to prepare for impacts from coastal storms, flooding, and erosion."

To generate future projections for Portland, Farmington, and Lewiston, simulated temperature and precipitation from four climate models were fitted to local, long-term weather observations.  Two future scenarios were used for estimated carbon emissions. For the  lower emissions scenario, conservation practices and development of renewable energy reduce emissions below those of today by 2100. In the higher \r\nemissions scenario, fossil fuels are assumed to remain a primary energy resource, and emissions grow four times the amount of today by 2100.  The scenarios describe climate in terms of temperature and precipitation for three future periods: the  near-term, 2010-2039, mid-century, 2040-2069, and end-of-century, 2070-2099.

Discussions have begun on how to reduce and eventually eliminate the rapid and accelerating additions of carbon dioxide, other greenhouse gases, and other pollutants to the world’s atmosphere and oceans. These efforts are vitally important and urgent for Maine and the rest of the world.  This report considers past change over geologic time, recent evidence of accelerated rates of change, and the implications of continued climate change in Maine during the 21st century as a result of greenhouse gas emissions and their associated pollutants. Even if a coordinated response succeeds in eliminating excess greenhouse gas emissions by the end of the century, something that appears highly unlikely today, climate change will continue because the elevated levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) can persist in the atmosphere for thousands of years to come.  It includes a section on the Gulf of Maine as well as other sectors that relate to the coastal environment. \r\n	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Completed Regional Or State New England Maine Public Health and Safety Infrastructure Managed Ecosystems Natural Ecosystems Social and Cultural Resources Economic Resources Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Climate Impacts on Water Resources Changes in Extremes of Weather and Climate Assess Climate and its Impacts Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Plans, Assessments, Studies	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	Maine's Climate Future: An Initial Assessment\r\n	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	University of Maine, Climate Change Institute\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://climatechange.umaine.edu/files/Maines_Climate_Future.pdf\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	\N	f

The objective of the project is to identify areas of the landscape where tidal marshes can migrate or expand under several SLR scenarios, and to provide that information to relevant public and private planning and conservation organizations.  Thus far the project is only addressing south coastal Maine, as that is the portion of the coast for which LiDAR data was available when we started.  We will eventually expand the project coast wide as LiDAR for the remainder of the coast has recently become available.  Our SLR simulation is a simple bathtub model and does not attempt to address any of the dynamic processes affecting the development of tidal marshes.  At this point we are not attempting to predict where marshes might be lost or where whole new systems might form, rather just where existing marshes might migrate or expand to.\r\n\r\nSteps in the project completed to date:\r\n\r\n- all tidal marshes greater than 5 acres excluding isolated fringing marsh have been mapped in GIS using ortho photography\r\n- ground truthing of LiDAR accuracy in and adjacent to marshes was completed across the range of the project\r\n- ground truthing of vegetation was completed in a subset of remotely mapped marshes across the range of the project\r\n- GIS simulations for 1 meter and 0.6 meters highest annual tide (HAT) of SLR that identify undeveloped areas of the landscape where existing marshes might migrate or expand to have also been completed (see attached map for sample of results).\r\n\r\nSteps remaining include analysis of the results, formatting the data for external use, and sharing the data with potential users."\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Ongoing Regional Or State New England Maine Natural Ecosystems Wetlands (e.g., saltwater, brackish, freshwater; tidal/non-tidal) Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Forecasts of Climate Conditions Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Projections (intra-annual to multi-decadal, including SLR and model down-scaling) Maps (Imagery, geo-referenced data)	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	SLR Simulation	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	t	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f

The authors project future sea level rise based on historical measurements and global scenarios, and apply them to digital elevation models to demonstrate the vulnerability of New Jersey's coast.  The authors estimate that 1 to 3 % of New Jersey’s land area will be  affected by inundation and 6.5 to over 9 % by episodic coastal flooding over the next century.  Possible impacts to natural systems and socioeconomic impacts are also summarized.  A range of adaptation and mitigation options for the coastal area are also outlines.  The report suggests that where possible a gradual withdrawal of development from some areas of the New Jersey coast may be the optimum management strategy for protecting natural ecosystems. \r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Completed Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic New Jersey Infrastructure Managed Ecosystems Natural Ecosystems Biota Social and Cultural Resources Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Improve Scientific Understanding of the Climate System and Essential Climate Variables Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Forecasts of Climate Impacts  Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Coastal and Oceanic Surface (Sea-surface temperature, sea level, salinity, ocean color, wave height) Sub-surface (e.g., temperature, salinity, nutrients, carbon, phytoplankton) Maps (Imagery, geo-referenced data) Plans, Assessments, Studies Adaptation/Action Plan Risk and Vulnerability	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	FUTURE SEA LEVEL RISE AND THE NEW JERSEY COAST Assessing Potential Impacts and Opportunities\r\n	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs Princeton University\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://cdn.publicinterestnetwork.org/assets/sR9N-sL9cXyA7pGI_ODVlw/Future_Sea_Level_Rise.pdf\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

This study was part of a broader assessment of New Jersey’s coastal environmental resources conducted by the Walton Center for Remote Sensing & Spatial Analysis (CRSSA) of Rutgers University and the American Littoral Society.  This report expands on Cooper et al., 2005.  "The primary objectives of this work is to examine six specific issues related to coastal vulnerability and future adaptability: to map near shore development; to map the land use/land cover that is vulnerable to tidal surge inundation and flooding; to map the distance from coastal waters to the first developed obstruction (i.e. how far removed is existing development from the surging coastal waters); to map the degree of shoreline alteration due to coastal protection structures; to map where coastal beach and dune habitats are relatively undisturbed; and delineate those portions of our coastal wetland complex that are free to retreat inland as part of the natural landward migration process (i.e., where are coastal wetlands bordered by undeveloped vs. developed uplands).

CRSSA is responsible for the technical aspects, while JC NERR is responsible for the collaborative, evaluation/assessment and knowledge dissemination portions of the project.  In summary, the proposed project has three main outcomes: 1) serve as a demonstration project as to the feasibility and utility of enhanced GIS/LiDAR-based assessment of coastal infrastructure and habitat vulnerability to sea level rise; and 2) develop a suite internet-accessible geospatial and database visualization and analysis tools that will facilitate the dissemination of this information; and 3) promote enhanced preparedness and land use planning decisions in the face of continued sea level rise. The first step in this project is to conduct a needs assessment of our intended users to (1) identify their current level and source of information regarding sea level rise and climate change impacts to New Jersey’s bay and ocean front , (2) identify parameters that are most important to their decision-making (http://www.jcnerr.org/Needs%20Assessment%20Final%20report.pdf), (3) determine their level of comfort with online mapping and decision support tools (http://www.jcnerr.org/Usability%20Testing.final%20report.pdf), (4) determine the best structure for querying and interacting with the CV10 DSS, (5) determine what would enable or prevent them from using such a product. \r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Ongoing Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic New Jersey Infrastructure Managed Ecosystems Natural Ecosystems Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Risk Assessments Forecasts of Climate Conditions Forecasts of Climate Impacts  Coastal and Oceanic Surface (Sea-surface temperature, sea level, salinity, ocean color, wave height) Forecasts and outlooks (monthly to annual, models)  Projections (intra-annual to multi-decadal, including SLR and model down-scaling) Maps (Imagery, geo-referenced data) Risk and Vulnerability Viewers and Web-based Tools Visualization tools (web-based, mapping programs)	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	Place-based Decision Support System to Assess Vulnerability of New Jersey’s Coast to Sea Level Rise\r\n	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	t	f	Jacques Cousteau National Estuarine Research Reserve\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://ciceet.unh.edu/progressreports/2010/9_2010/lathrop09/index.html\r\n	f	f	t	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

THe CCVAP  is a GIS-based tool that was developed to help land use planners, hazard mitigation planners, emergency managers, and other local decision-makers to identify vulnerability to coastal hazards and sea-level rise at the community level.   The CCVAP oultines the needed steps to identify  vulnerable land areas under present and future inundation scenarios geospatially.  Using these inundation scenarios (0.5 meters, 1.0 meters, and 1.5 meters), coastal decision-makers  now have a greater ability determine the potential inundation threats to  built infrastructure, sensitive natural resources, and special needs populations.  The resilience asseessment is a facilitated questionnaire.  It is a non-regulatory tool that is meant to help local decision-makers collaboratively  identify planning, mitigation, and adaptation opportunities to reduce vulnerability to coastal storms and sea level rise, building  capacity for coastal community resilience.  It is provides a starting point for a dialogue among various decision-makers, helping to spawn creative thinking and collaboration on ways to become more resilient for existing and future generations.  The questionnaire highlights the importance of local plan integration and consistency with municipal building codes and ordinances, and it identifies the importance of localized hazard assessments and the need to link them to planning, outreach, mitigation, response, and recovery. The report also discusses the Coastal Vulnerability Index.	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Completed Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic New Jersey Infrastructure Managed Ecosystems Natural Ecosystems Biota Social and Cultural Resources Economic Resources Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Physical Coastal and Oceanic Surface (Sea-surface temperature, sea level, salinity, ocean color, wave height) Forecasts and outlooks (monthly to annual, models)  Projections (intra-annual to multi-decadal, including SLR and model down-scaling) Plans, Assessments, Studies Maps (Imagery, geo-referenced data) Risk and Vulnerability Viewers and Web-based Tools Visualization tools (web-based, mapping programs)	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, Coastal Management Office\r\n	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Dorina Frizzera, NJ DEP,   (609) 777-3251 or dorina.frizzera@dep.state.nj.us\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.nj.gov/dep/cmp/docs/ccvap-greenwich.pdf\r\n	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

This informaiton can assist a community in understanding where hazards may be more likely to occur.   To help determine where high hazard areas are within a community or the coastal zone , the New Jersey Coastal Management Office developed a geospatial, composite overlay model or a coastal vulnerability index.  The model includes six  geospatial inputs, including  storm surge inundation scenarios, low slopes, flood prone areas, poorly drained soils, erosion prone areas, and geomorphology.  By incorporating sea level rise scenarios into storm \r\nsurge models, the Coastal Management Office could visually demonstrate how climate \r\nchange may shift high hazard areas further inland overtime.  This coastal vulnerability assessmnet may be useful in identifying locations for the investment of mitigation assistance.  It may also identify where engineering and adaptation actions to address climate change may be extremely difficult or ineffective.

The New Jersey Department of Fish and Wildlife has been working with Rutgers University's Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy on a vulnerability assessment for the habitats in the Plan. The effort has been to assess the vulnerability of a sampling of the State’s habitats to the effects of climate change.  The process used a variety of proven metrics to rank habitats’ susceptibility to anticipated stressors, such as increased temperature, more severe storm events, and sea level rise.  The resulting ranking will be used to inform decision makers’ actions, including an upcoming revision to the State’s Wildlife Action Plan (WAP).  \r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Planned Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic New Jersey Managed Ecosystems Natural Ecosystems Biota Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Plans, Assessments, Studies Risk and Vulnerability	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	State Wildlife Action Plan Update\r\n	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, Division of Fish and Wildlife \r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.state.nj.us/dep/fgw/ensp/waphome.htm\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

This project is to be modeled after the Partnership of the Delaware’s living shoreline projects as presented at the Climate Change technical Workshop. The project’s goal will to be slow the erosion of the marsh, but the project’s objectives will include utilizing volunteers, partners and the public in a hand’s on stewardship activity, raising the awareness of eroding shorelines and to educate Refuge visitors about the impacts of climate change, specifically sea level rise. Planning for this project begins on May 11, 2010. As of late-spring, both the NJ Land Use Regulations Department and the Army Corps of Engineers have given the permits needed.

Sea level rise is a significant and growing threat to the coastal region of New Jersey, USA and this study presents a comprehensive assessment of the expected impacts.  We project future \r\nsea level rise based on historical measurements and global scenarios, and apply them to digital elevation models to illustrate the extent to which the New Jersey coast is vulnerable.  We estimate that 1 to 3 % of New Jersey’s land area will be affected by inundation and 6.5 to over 9 % by episodic coastal flooding over the next century.  We also characterize potential impacts on \r\nthe socioeconomic and natural systems of the New Jersey coast focusing on Cape May Point for illustrative purposes.  We then suggest a range of potential adaptation and mitigation opportunities for managing coastal areas in response to sea level rise.  Our findings suggest that where possible a gradual withdrawal of development from some areas of the New Jersey coast may be the optimum management strategy for protecting natural ecosystems.	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Completed Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic New Jersey Infrastructure Managed Ecosystems Natural Ecosystems Social and Cultural Resources Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Forecasts of Climate Conditions Forecasts and outlooks (monthly to annual, models)  Projections (intra-annual to multi-decadal, including SLR and model down-scaling) Maps (Imagery, geo-referenced data) Plans, Assessments, Studies Risk and Vulnerability	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	FUTURE SEA LEVEL RISE AND THE NEW JERSEY COAST Assessing Potential Impacts and Opportunities \r\n	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Princeton University\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.princeton.edu/step/people/faculty/michael-oppenheimer/recent-publications/Future-Sea-Level-Rise-and-the-New-Jersey-Coast-Assessing-Potential-Impacts-and-Opportunities.pdf\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

The strength of this tool is its ability to visually show the modeling of sea level rise predictions, allowing people to see the impacts in a more intuitive way.\r\nIt provides tools for improved understanding of results from research projects that use Version 2.0. SLAMM-View was designed for a user-friendly, workflow-based approach to assess impacts of sea-level rise on coastal areas with both visualization and analysis functionality. SLAMM-View provides simultaneous comparison between both current and future conditions out to the year 2100, and among different sea-level rise scenarios (e.g., 0.4 meter vs. 1 meter), using interactive maps and tabular reporting capabilities. The model simulations include 5 main processes that affect wetland fate under sea-level rise: innundation, erosion, overwash, saturation, and salinity.  \r\nTo date, SLAMM-View provides access to SLAMM simulation results for the entire coastlines of 5 states, and partial coverage of an additional 4 states.	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	 Ongoing Completed National Regional Or State New England Mid-Atlantic South East New Jersey Marlyland Delaware Virginia District Of Columbia Natural Ecosystems Coasts Estuaries Wetlands (e.g., saltwater, brackish, freshwater; tidal/non-tidal) Oceans Inland Habitats and Watersheds  Beaches Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Improve Scientific Understanding of the Climate System and Essential Climate Variables Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Downscale Climate Models Forecasts of Climate Conditions Forecasts of Climate Impacts  Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Physical Surface (air temperature, precipitation, wind) Surface (Sea-surface temperature, sea level, salinity, ocean color, wave height) Coastal and Oceanic Sub-surface (e.g., temperature, salinity, nutrients, carbon, phytoplankton) Climate Society Interactions Decision Making Risk Assessment or Risk Management Policy Planning In situ Observations Depth and Elevation Data Maps (Imagery, geo-referenced data) Projections (intra-annual to multi-decadal, including SLR and model down-scaling) Impact Study Risk and Vulnerability Viewers and Web-based Tools Visualization tools (web-based, mapping programs)	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	Sea-Level Rise Affecting Marshes Mode (SLAMM)	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	Provide a web based tool that displays pairs of maps of the same area at different levels of sea levels and the projected changes to marshes.	f	f	f	t	f	USFWS	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.fws.gov/slamm/	f	f	t	t	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f

As coastal populations continue to grow, and community infrastructures are threatened by erosion, there is increased demand for accurate information regarding past and present shoreline changes. There is also need for a comprehensive analysis of shoreline movement that is regionally consistent. To meet these national needs, the Coastal and Marine Geology Program of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is conducting an analysis of historical shoreline changes along open-ocean sandy shores of the conterminous United States and parts of Alaska and Hawaii. A primary goal of this work is to develop standardized methods for mapping and analyzing shoreline movement so that internally consistent updates can periodically be made to record shoreline erosion and accretion.     This report on the New England and Mid-Atlantic coasts is the fifth in a series of reports on historical shoreline change.  This report, like the earlier reports, summarizes the methods of analysis, interprets the results, provides explanations regarding long-term and short-term trends and rates of change, and describes how different coastal communities are responding to coastal erosion.                                                                                                                                             	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 National Regional Or State New England Mid-Atlantic Risk Assessments Assess Climate and its Impacts Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Risk and Vulnerability Plans, Assessments, Studies	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	National Assessment of Shoreline Change: Historical Shoreline Change along the New England and Mid-Atlantic Coasts	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	USGS	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	\N	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2010/1118/	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

As climate changes over the coming century, these problems facing coastal communities will likely worsen. Good management and policy decision-making require baseline information on the rates, trends, and scientific understanding of the processes of coastal change on a regional to national scale. To address this need, the U.S. Geological Survey is engaged in a research project of national scope to measure, report, and interpret historical shoreline change along open-ocean coasts of the United States. One of the primary goals of this project is to understand shoreline change hazards using methods that are comparable from one area of the country to another and that will allow for future, repeatable analyses of shoreline movement, coastal erosion, and land loss.	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 National Natural Ecosystems Coasts Assess Climate and its Impacts Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Plans, Assessments, Studies Risk and Vulnerability Impact Study Risk and Vulnerability Problem Focused	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	USGS Science for the Nation’s Changing Coasts: \r\nShoreline Change Research Fact Sheet	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	USGS	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2011/3073/	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

The project synthesizes information on coastal environments and uncertainties in knowledge of coastal processes into a Bayesian statistical analysis framework. The Bayesian approach allows researchers to evaluate the probability of a number of sea-level rise impacts, and provides information that can be used for decision making.\r\nThe Bayesian statistical framework is ideal for using data sets derived from historical or modern observations such as long-term shoreline change or wetland accretion/elevation trends. This information can be combined with model simulations and used to define the relationships between key variables in coastal environments. A Bayesian Network provides a means of integrating these data to evaluate competing hypotheses regarding the relationships between forcing factors (e.g., rate of SLR, suspended sediment concentration, elevation change), and responses (e.g., shoreline change, wetland vertical accretion, water table change). This framework allows scientists to make probabilistic predictions of the future state of coastal environments for outcomes such as shoreline change, wetland survival, and changes in the depth to groundwater. The predictions also have estimates of outcome uncertainty that can be expressed as both numbers (e.g., 90%) and words (e.g., very likely). The ability to communicate SLR impacts in terms of a probabilistic prediction can improve scientists’ ability to support decision making and evaluate specific management questions about alternatives for addressing SLR. This information can also identify research needed to improve predictive skill.	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Completed National Natural Ecosystems Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Assess Climate and its Impacts Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Coastal and Oceanic Surface (Sea-surface temperature, sea level, salinity, ocean color, wave height) Physical Risk Assessment or Risk Management Climate Society Interactions Risk and Vulnerability Plans, Assessments, Studies Viewers and Web-based Tools Management Guidance (i.e. structured decision making) Training and Capacity Building Adaptation and Mitigation Guidance, including Best Practices Manuals, Toolkits, and Guides	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	Sea-level Rise Hazards and Decision Support	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	U.S. Geological Survey	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://wh.er.usgs.gov/slr/index.html	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

Consequently, there has been an increased focus on developing modeling or other analytical approaches to evaluate potential impacts to inform coastal management. This report provides the data that were used to develop and evaluate the performance of a Bayesian network designed to predict long-term shoreline change due to sea-level rise. The data include local rates of relative sea-level rise, wave height, tide range, geomorphic classification, coastal slope, and shoreline-change rate compiled as part of the U.S. Geological Survey Coastal Vulnerability Index for the U.S. Atlantic coast. In this project, the Bayesian network is used to define relationships among driving forces, geologic constraints, and coastal responses. Using this information, the Bayesian network is used to make probabilistic predictions of shoreline change in response to different future sea-level-rise scenarios.	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 National Infrastructure Natural Ecosystems Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Assess Climate and its Impacts Risk Assessments Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Coastal and Oceanic Surface (Sea-surface temperature, sea level, salinity, ocean color, wave height) Projections (intra-annual to multi-decadal, including SLR and model down-scaling) Risk and Vulnerability Plans, Assessments, Studies	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	A Bayesian Network to Predict Vulnerability to Sea-Level Rise: Data Report	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Robert Thieler, USGS, rthieler@usgs.gov, (508) 457-2350	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/601/	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

The five MARCO states agreed to work together to develop a regional, web-based portal as part of their 2009 action plan. In response to this need, the Virginia Coastal Zone Management Program provided funding (through their CZM Award from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration- NOAA) for creation of this prototype mapping and planning portal for the Mid-Atlantic region. The portal was developed by a team of representatives from each of the Mid-Atlantic States, NOAA, and The Nature Conservancy.   The portal includes map data layers grouped into five broad categories:\r\nAdministrative (e.g. official boundaries)\r\nBiological (e.g. sea‐floor habitats)\r\nGeophysical (e.g. water depth, sediments)\r\nHuman Uses (e.g. fishing, shipping)\r\nDecision Support (e.g. overlays of various uses and natural features). The portal includes a sea-level rise vulnerability layer based on the coastal vulnerability index under the Geophysical category.	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	\N	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic New York New Jersey Marlyland Delaware Virginia District Of Columbia Infrastructure Energy Managed Ecosystems Fisheries Natural Ecosystems Biota Inland Habitats and Watersheds  Sustainability of Marine Ecosystems Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Changes in Extremes of Weather and Climate Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Assess Climate and its Impacts Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Ecological and Biological Vulnerability Assessment Risk and Vulnerability Plans, Assessments, Studies Viewers and Web-based Tools Visualization tools (web-based, mapping programs)	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	Mid-Atlantic Regional Council on the Ocean (MARCO) Portal\r\n	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	MARCO, Mid-Atlantic States, The Nature Conservancy (TNC)\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.midatlanticocean.org/map_portal.html	f	f	t	t	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

Virtually every industry from agriculture, electric power and\r\nindustrial manufacturing to beverage, apparel, and tourism relies on it to grow and ultimately\r\nsustain their business.\r\nYet water is becoming scarcer globally and every indication is that it will become even more\r\nso in the future. Decreasing availability, declining quality, and growing demand for water are\r\ncreating significant challenges to businesses and investors who have traditionally taken clean,\r\nreliable and inexpensive water for granted. These problems are already causing decreases\r\nin companies’ water allotments, shifts toward full-cost water pricing, more stringent water\r\nquality regulations, growing community opposition, and increased public scrutiny of corporate\r\nwater practices.\r\nThis Ceres/Pacific Institute report concludes that climate change will exacerbate these water\r\nrisks, especially as the world population grows by 50 million a year.	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	 Completed Climate Impacts on Water Resources Regional Or State National International Public Health and Safety Infrastructure Fresh Water Resources	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	Water Scarcity & Climate Change: Growing Risks for Businesses & Investors	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	CERES, Pacific Institute	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.pacinst.org/reports/business_water_climate/full_report.pdf	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	\N	f

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)\r\n\r\nFourth Assessment Report, 1 Climate Change 2007: Synthesis Report, forecasts that climate change will have significant impacts on populations and environments around the world. Furthermore, it is likely that in the absence of concerted efforts to mitigate greenhouse emissions, climate change will have negative effects on business and global markets. It will likely lead to a change in existing business models and current risk management structures. \r\n\r\nThis publication is focused on providing an overview of adaptation from a business perspective. It describes potential impacts of climate changes, risks and opportunities for business, and why business should consider adaptation planning and measures. It summarizes intergovernmental efforts to promote adaptation in vulnerable regions and highlights areas in which business could have a role in promoting adaptation, both at community and global levels.\r\n	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	 Completed International National Regional Or State Recreation and Tourism Social and Cultural Resources Economic Resources Cross Disciplinary Biota Natural Ecosystems Managed Ecosystems Infrastructure Public Health and Safety	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	Adaptation: An Issue Brief for Business	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	World Business Council	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.preventionweb.net/files/7781_Adaptation1.pdf	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

Other\r\ndifferences may be based on policies and measures that have lowered emissions in some states, and could be\r\nreplicated in others. Identifying the causes of interstate differences in emissions may also help clarify the\r\npotential regional impacts of policies, such as a cap and trade system, which put a price on carbon emissions.	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Completed Regional Or State New England Mid-Atlantic Central Great Lakes South East South Carolina North Carolina Ohio West Virginia District Of Columbia Virginia Delaware Marlyland Pennsylvania New Jersey New York Rhode Island Connecticut Vermont Massachusetts New Hampshire Maine Viewers and Web-based Tools Management Guidance (i.e. structured decision making) Regulatory/ Policy Guidance	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	t	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	Greenhouse Gases and the American Lifestyle: Understanding Interstate Differences in Emissions	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	t	f	t	f	\N	f	f	t	f	f	Ecotrust, Economics for Equity and the Environment, Stockholm Environment Institute Report	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	\N	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.e3network.org/papers/NRDC_state_emissions_report.pdf	f	t	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	\N	f

The framework addresses three issues complicating assessments of climate change impacts--linkages across spatial scales, linkages across temporal scales, and linkages across scientific and management disciplines. A major theme underlying the framework is that, due to current limitations in modeling capabilities, assessing and responding to climate change should be approached from the perspective of risk assessment and management rather than as a prediction problem. The framework is based generally on ecological risk assessment and similar approaches. A second theme underlying the framework is the need for close collaboration among climate scientists, scientists interested in assessing impacts, and resource managers and decision makers. A case study illustrating an application of the framework is also presented that provides a specific, practical example of how the framework was used to assess the impacts of climate change on water quality in a mid-Atlantic, U.S., watershed.	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) National Regional Or State Public Health and Safety Infrastructure Managed Ecosystems Natural Ecosystems Biota Social and Cultural Resources Recreation and Tourism Economic Resources	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	A Framework for Assessing Climate Change Impacts on Water and Watershed Systems	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	EPA Office of Research and Development	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18830740	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

It focuses on climate change impacts in different regions of the U.S. and on various aspects of society and the economy such as energy, water, agriculture, and health. It’s also a report written in plain language, with the goal of better informing public and private decision making at all levels.\r\n\r\nIn addition to discussing the impacts of climate change in the U.S., the report also highlights the choices we face in response to human-induced climate change. It is clear that impacts in the United States are already occurring and are projected to increase in the future, particularly if the concentration of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere continues to rise. So, choices about how we manage greenhouse gas emissions will have far-reaching consequences for climate change impacts. Similarly, there are choices to be made about adaptation strategies that can help to reduce or avoid some of the undesirable impacts of climate change. This report provides many of the scientific underpinnings for effective decisions to be made – at the national and at the regional level. \r\n\r\n	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Completed National Public Health and Safety Infrastructure Energy Fresh Water Resources Communication and Commerce Transportation Built Coast (e.g., engineered solutions for shoreline protection) Managed Ecosystems Agriculture Natural Ecosystems Biota Social and Cultural Resources Recreation and Tourism Economic Resources Assess Climate and its Impacts Improve Scientific Understanding of the Climate System and Essential Climate Variables	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Global Change Research Progam	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	http://www.globalchange.gov/publications/reports/scientific-assessments/us-impacts	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

Discussions have begun on how to reduce and eventually eliminate the rapid and accelerating additions of carbon dioxide, other greenhouse gases, and other pollutants to the world’s atmosphere and oceans. These efforts are vitally important and urgent for Maine and the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nThis report considers past change over geologic time, recent evidence of accelerated rates of change, and the implications of continued climate change in Maine during the 21st century as a result of greenhouse gas emissions and their associated pollutants. Even if a coordinated response succeeds in eliminating excess greenhouse gas emissions by the end of the century, something that appears highly unlikely today, climate change will continue because the elevated levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) can persist in the atmosphere for thousands of years to come.	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Completed National Regional Or State New England Maine Forecasts and outlooks (monthly to annual, models)  Plans, Assessments, Studies	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	Maine's Climate Future Report	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	University of Maine	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://climatechange.umaine.edu/research/publications/climate-future	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

Real-Time Kinematic GPS was used to attain elevation data for S. alterniflora to determine the elevational growth range. LiDAR was used during project design to ensure a representative elevation range was sampled. The MVI classifies healthy, degrading, and severely degrading short-form Spartina alterniflora marsh regions .\r\n\r\nThe MVI will be essential for evaluating wetland vulnerability to sea-level rise on a watershed or statewide basis, while also enabling the strategic placement of monitoring resources to enhance efforts to understand the future evolution and migration potential of Delaware’s tidal wetlands, as well as promiting conservation and restoration. MVI classification optimizes the monitoring efforts and resources to the highest levels possible, so the broadest extent of Delaware’s tidal wetlands may be evaluated and managed.

The goal of the Sea Level Rise Initiative is to reduce Delaware’s future vulnerability to the effects of sea level rise.  This will be accomplished by: providing scientific and technical support for decision-making, implementing on-the-ground project in partnership with stakeholders, providing educational and outreach opportunities for stakeholders and the public, improving existing policies and management practices and/or developing new policies and management practices where necessary.    \r\nThe Sea Level Rise Initiative is designed to be iterative and will grow and \r\nchange as new data, outreach and policy needs are identified.  Part of this initiative is developing a Sea-Level Rise Adaptation Plan. The Initiative website includes all relevant activities as does the 2011 Compendium.	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Ongoing Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic Delaware Public Health and Safety Infrastructure Managed Ecosystems Natural Ecosystems Biota Social and Cultural Resources Economic Resources Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Improve Scientific Understanding of the Climate System and Essential Climate Variables Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Promote Public Climate Literacy Coastal and Oceanic Climate Society Interactions Physical Coastal and Oceanic Surface (Sea-surface temperature, sea level, salinity, ocean color, wave height) Maps (Imagery, geo-referenced data) Projections (intra-annual to multi-decadal, including SLR and model down-scaling) Plans, Assessments, Studies Vulnerability Assessment Engagement Engagement	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	Delaware Sea-Level Rise Initiative	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	t	f	Delaware Coastal Management Program	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.dnrec.delaware.gov/coastal/Pages/SeaLevelRiseAdaptation.aspx\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

These maps reflect the filling of these watersheds at constant elevations also referred to as "Bath Tub" modeling. In other words, the maps show the water levels rising in the watersheds similar to the “filling of a bathtub”.   These maps  represent a constant,  watershed based,  water level and  do not include any changes in water level due to the distance from tidal forcing, downstream flow, or other factors  which could possibly change water levels.  There are various uses for these maps including: assessing and planning land use and zoning ordinances to protect community resources while guiding new development; developing emergency management plans to prepare for natural disasters like nor’easters or tropical storms; determining impacts to the economy such as changes to the business and tourism sectors; conserving wildlife, wetlands, beaches, and other natural resources; protecting recreational areas like fishing spots, boating areas, parks, and cultural heritage locations; developing future plans for infrastructure like roads, fire departments, schools, sewer systems, drinking water, etc.; managing agriculture practices to conserve working farm lands and protect irrigation sources; and planning for coastal community resiliency by determining hazards and vulnerabilities.	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Completed Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic Delaware Public Health and Safety Infrastructure Managed Ecosystems Natural Ecosystems Social and Cultural Resources Economic Resources Assess Climate and its Impacts Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Physical Coastal and Oceanic Surface (Sea-surface temperature, sea level, salinity, ocean color, wave height) Maps (Imagery, geo-referenced data) Projections (intra-annual to multi-decadal, including SLR and model down-scaling)	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	Delaware Sea-Level Rise Inundation Maps	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Delaware Coastal Programs	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.dnrec.delaware.gov/Pages/SLRMaps.aspx	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

Investigation of such impacts, specifically marsh depletion and increased mudflats at Bombay Hook, will be conducted to determine patterns of sediment flux in or out of the depleted marsh area. Data collection will involve conducting river transects within the Leipsic River using the Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) and associated software to collect and process tide and current data. Water quality will also be monitored, specifically total sediment solids (TSS) to aid in determining sediment fluxes in or out of the depleted marsh area.\r\n\r\nThis study will result in a written report that includes a summary of results; discussion of data analysis and statistical procedures. Results will be used to predict future changes in marsh depletion and to help determine marsh management techniques to counteract these impacts affecting the tidal \r\nmarshes at Bombay Hook.	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Completed Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic Delaware Natural Ecosystems Assess Climate and its Impacts Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Coastal and Oceanic Surface (Sea-surface temperature, sea level, salinity, ocean color, wave height) Sub-surface (e.g., temperature, salinity, nutrients, carbon, phytoplankton) Physical Surveys and PreliminaryAssessments	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	Bombay Hook Hydrology/ Sediment Movement Study 	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	DNREC Delaware Coastal Programs, US Fish and Wildlife Service	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.dnrec.delaware.gov/coastal/Documents/SeaLevelRise/SLRCompSept2011.pdf	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

The report notes that using a collaborative approach to obtain lidar data makes sense as that decreases agency costs while meeting multiple needs. However, not all data will fit everyone’s needs. \r\nThe statewide lidar coverage came from two separate collection projects implemented two years apart.  When the projects were proposed, few in the state were familiar with the LiDAR or had the capacity to work with such large data sets.\r\nUnderstanding what  initial users want to do with the data provides only part of the information needed. Understanding potential data uses and the requirements of the end user helps ensure that the data stay valuable by meeting present and future needs.\r\nThe availability of statewide LiDAR data in Delaware was delayed because project participants had to integrate non-standardized data sets and formats. Based on lessons learned from the two projects, future LiDAR collection project in Delaware will begin by identifying common end user goals. In addition, the following measures will be taken:\r\n• Data specifications and formats will be standardized\r\n• The end user’s technical capacity will be considered\r\n• All deliverables will be described adequately to ensure complete delivery\r\n• End users will review the contracts before their final acceptance	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Completed Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic Delaware Natural Ecosystems Coastal and Oceanic Surface (Sea-surface temperature, sea level, salinity, ocean color, wave height) Physical Other Training and Capacity Building Data Support tools (help using specific data products)	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	Lessons Learned from Delaware LiDAR	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Delaware Coastal Programs	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.csc.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/_/pdf/de_lessons.pdf\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

Due to the many unique features of the Estuary,\r\nsome aspects of changing climate may not be as severe here as in nearby watersheds and estuaries, whereas other changes may be more important. Since 2008, the Partnership for the Delaware Estuary has engaged experts from throughout the region to conduct an assessment of the vulnerabilities and adaptation options for three key resources of the Delaware Estuary: tidal\r\nwetlands, drinking water, and bivalve shellfish. These provide three case studies – a habitat case study, a human/water use case study, and a living resource case study – for looking at climate change impacts and how best to adapt to them here in the Delaware Estuary. These case studies represent the very first step in an adaptation planning process, the goal of which is to ensure the resiliency of this vast and valuable system as climate changes.   For all three case studies, the top concerns among experts are the vulnerabilities of key resources to sea‐level rise and salinity changes, and flooding and precipitation effects. Whereas, many estuaries around the world are concerned with sea‐level rise, the vulnerability to salinity rise in the Delaware Estuary is somewhat unique, and especially notable because this system has the world’s largest freshwater tidal prism. Adaptation actions are outlined for each resource as well.  	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Completed Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Climate Impacts on Water Resources Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic Delaware Infrastructure Managed Ecosystems Natural Ecosystems Biota Recreation and Tourism Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Physical Coastal and Oceanic Surface (Sea-surface temperature, sea level, salinity, ocean color, wave height) Sub-surface (e.g., temperature, salinity, nutrients, carbon, phytoplankton) Plans, Assessments, Studies Adaptation/Action Plan Risk and Vulnerability Engagement	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	Climate Change and the Delaware Estuary	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Partnership for the Delaware Estuary	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	t	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.delawareestuary.org/science_projects_climate_ready_products.asp	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	\N	f

The report estimates gains and losses in the ecological service flows provided by coastal habitats as well as the type and size of projects necessary to maintain current wetland services.  Potentially, these projects can be either restoration of degraded habitats or preventative measures taken to avoid future loss.

This document is part of a project designed to generate climate-smart guidance for restoration and management projects to safeguard fish, wildlife, and their habitats from the impacts of climate change.   This coastal climate-smart guidance is an initial step to provide wildlife and natural resource managers  practical tools for ensuring that current and future projects are maximizing benefits to ecosystems and critical species. NWF convened an expert panel to develop a process for defining climate-smart conservation for the coastal system and to provide climate-smart options that natural resource managers could consider when planning and implementing projects. The panel selected two project types in the coastal environment on which to focus: coastal impoundments and living shorelines.

This project was funded by the Wildlife Conservation Society/Doris Duke.  This report includes the results of a vulnerability assessment of fish and wildife and their habitats to climate change.  The questions answered in this report include: How do the SWAP-targeted fish and wildlife habitats rank in terms of their likely comparative vulnerabilities to climate change?;   How will the representation of these habitats in Massachusetts be altered by a changing climate?;  Which vertebrate Species in Greatest Need of Conservation are likely to be most vulnerable to climate change?; and What degree of confidence can be assigned to the above predictions? An expert panel was formed to answer these questions and conduct the assessment and 20 habitats were analyzed.  Species of Greatest Conservation Need were also assessed.  	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Completed Regional Or State New England Massachusetts Managed Ecosystems Natural Ecosystems Biota Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Plans, Assessments, Studies Vulnerability Assessment	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	Climate Change and Massachusetts Fish and Wildlife: Volume 2 Habitat and Vulnerability 	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Massachusetts Division of Fish and Wildlife, Manomet Center for Conservation Sciences	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.mass.gov/dfwele/dfw/habitat/cwcs/pdf/climate_change_habitat_vulnerability.pdf \r\n	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

In the United States, buildings consume 12% of the total available fresh water, 30% of the materials, and 70% of the electricity produced (US EPA, 2004). Aging water and wastewater infrastructure systems are overloaded from the increasing population and incessant construction throughout the United States (Grigg, 2003). Green building practices such as green roofs and water reuse can reduce these impacts and improve efficiency significantly. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has begun studying green technology as a potential solution for reducing the negative impacts of buildings. The EPA has a very broad scope of environmental research ranging from water and air pollution to larger infrastructural impacts. Within green technologies consideration is given to energy, materials, construction, and more related to our study, water and wastewater infrastructure. From 2003 to 2007, less than 2% of the EPA’s total research funding went to green building research, with most of it being extramurally distributed through grants (USGBC, 2008a). Of the 2% devoted to green building research, only 11% was used for water and storm water research. Considering the current environmental issues and the benefits of green buildings, this level of research on green water technologies is insufficient. The goal of this project was to provide recommendations to the EPA’s National Center for Environmental Research (NCER) regarding potential future research areas with a focus on the impacts of green building on water and wastewater infrastructure.	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Completed National Public Health and Safety Infrastructure	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	Analysis of Green Building Water Infrastructure Technologies at the EPA NCER	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	EPA National Center for Environmental Research, WORCESTER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-121908-112935/unrestricted/Green_Building_Analysis_at_EPA_NCER.pdf	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

Black carbon, a soot component, is a potent climate driver that absorbs sunlight in the atmosphere, changes rainfall patterns, and when deposited on snow and ice, accelerates melting. In addition, soot can cause direct effects on health and agriculture. Climate and other effects of soot are magnified in broad regions where the strongest source emissions occur, but transported soot is also a major concern in the Arctic. The short atmospheric lifetime of soot particles also means that emissions reductions produce nearly immediate results, in contrast to most greenhouse gases (GHGs).	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Completed Changes in Extremes of Weather and Climate National Public Health and Safety Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	PEW Center on Global Climate Change	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	BLACK CARBON: A Science/Policy Primer	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.c2es.org/publications/black-carbon-primer	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

It directed the secretary of Energy and Environmental Affairs (EEA) to convene an advisory committee to develop a report, analyzing adaptation strategeis for projected climate changes. This report is by the Massachusetts Climate Change \r\nAdaptation Advisory Committee, and it is organized into two parts. Part I includes an overview of the observed and predicted changes to Massachusetts‘ climate and their anticipated impacts, key findings, a set of guiding principles, and key adaptation strategies, cutting across multiple sectors.  The second part of the report is organized into five  sections, including coastal zone and oceans as well as natural resources and habitat, key infrastructure, human health and welfare, and local economy and government. Each section includes a description of the vulnerabilities to climate change and  adaptation strategies that could help increase resilience and preparedness.  The coastal section focuses on the open ocean, bays, estuaries, salt marshes and tidal flats.  This section outlines vulnerabilities and adaptation strategies relating to land protection, policy, management and restoration, and monitoring.  The report also includes a section specific to wetlands, including coastal wetlands. Vulnerabilities relate to changes in temperature and precipitation, and adaptation strategies are identified relating to land protection, policy, management and restoration, and monitoring.	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Completed Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Changes in Extremes of Weather and Climate Regional Or State New England Massachusetts Public Health and Safety Infrastructure Managed Ecosystems Natural Ecosystems Biota Social and Cultural Resources Economic Resources Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Sustainability of Marine Ecosystems Climate Impacts on Water Resources Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Plans, Assessments, Studies Adaptation/Action Plan Recreation and Tourism	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	Massachusetts Climate Change Adaptation Report	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs and the Adaptation Advisory Committee	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	t	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	www.mass.gov/environment/cca \r\n	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	\N	f

Can the U.S. meet the Obama Administration’s\r\nCopenhagen commitment to reduce greenhouse gas\r\nemissions in the range of 17 percent below 2005 levels\r\nby 2020 using the regulatory tools already available\r\nto federal agencies, together with announced actions\r\nat the state level? Even if congressional action is\r\nultimately necessary to put the U.S. on a long-term\r\nlow-carbon path and aid in the transition to a lowcarbon\r\neconomy, can federal agencies and state\r\ngovernments get the U.S. started down that path? To\r\nhelp answer these and related questions, the World\r\nResources Institute (WRI) presents this analysis of\r\npotential reductions under existing federal authorities\r\nand announced state actions through 2030.	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Completed National Infrastructure Energy Transportation Economic Resources Management Guidance (i.e. structured decision making) Regulatory/ Policy Guidance	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	Reducing GHG Emission in the US Using Existing Authorities & State Action	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	World Resources Institute	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	http://pdf.wri.org/reducing_ghgs_using_existing_federal_authorities_and_state_action_summary.pdf	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

The document features reports prepared by interns at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) as part of the Massachusetts Climate Change Adaptation Project. Some students are part of the MIT-USGS Science Impact Collaborative (MUSIC). Their work is linked to the new Science, Decisions and Policy Program of the US Geological Survey which emphasizes ecosystem services, adaptive management; resilience, vulnerability and risk; along with the science of science policy. These students are trained to help groups with conflicting views have productive conversations. Ultimately, the goal was to enable governmental, corporate and civil society groups to engage in collaborative environmental management.	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Completed National Improve Scientific Understanding of the Climate System and Essential Climate Variables Regional Or State New England Massachusetts Public Health and Safety Infrastructure Natural Ecosystems Managed Ecosystems Recreation and Tourism Social and Cultural Resources Economic Resources Cross Disciplinary Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Plans, Assessments, Studies Management Guidance (i.e. structured decision making) Regulatory/ Policy Guidance	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	Managing Risk- Helping Cities in Massachusetts Adapt to Climate Change	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	MIT-USGS Science Impact Collaborative	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://web.mit.edu/dusp/epp/music/pdf/MUSIC_ClimateChange_High.pdf	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

For the coastal species and habitats, Heritage is assessing Tier 1 and Tier 2 sites in the Action Plan and looking at where the sites fall in terms of a range of sea-level rise scenarios (0-2, 2-5. 5-10 feet).  This helps determine which sites and species located there might be influenced by sea-level rise.

The objective is to identify and map high priority, currently upland areas suitable for salt marsh migration and reestablishment. The strategy will also identify opportunities to increase resilience to sea level rise and slow the rate of loss to open water of current ecologically valuable marshes. Both the Assessment and Strategy will be developed based on a synthesis of available information and will result in implementation activities to both protect priority lands in the county as well as engage in restoration and management activities to conserve marshes. Economic considerations regarding use of the landscape for conservation, recreation, agriculture, forestry and development will be factored in to the best of our ability. The strategic plan will be used to plan to use the strategic Assessment to: Identify appropriate land protection and management strategies for facilitating salt marsh migration as sea levels rise; Identify the most suitable locations in the project area for designation as marsh migration corridors where management should focus on providing the greatest possible contiguous extent of salt marsh through the 21st century under a 1.03m sea level rise scenario; Identify priority land parcels that should be conserved for potential marsh migration corridors; Recommend best management practices (BMPs) for facilitating salt marsh establishment on newly tidal lands and prioritize locations to apply BMPs to create new high marsh habitat for threatened salt marsh birds;\r\nRecommend which potential barriers to marsh migration should be removed or mitigated. Develop policies for barrier removal/mitigation and for preventing the creation of new barriers, e.g., physical defenses against sea level rise; and Identify strategies and/or areas for marsh restoration and management, including evaluating the feasibility of restoring marshes through adding sediment, and determining BMPs and locations for improving existing marsh habitat for salt marsh birds."	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Ongoing Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic Marlyland Natural Ecosystems Coasts Estuaries Wetlands (e.g., saltwater, brackish, freshwater; tidal/non-tidal) Oceans Biota Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Evaluation of Climate Change Tools and Data, Climate Change Specific Projects, Adaptation/ Climate-Smart Planning	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	Maryland Blackwater Inland	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	t	Maryland Audubon and The Conservation Fund\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f

A Risk Management plan will be developed to address different climate change risks and to incorporate low and high cost responses over the short and long term. Public outreach will include use of the City’s website to publish information about climate change as well as solicit input from the public to be used as the basis for  the community process that will be part of the Master Plan update. Neither the concept of climate adaptation nor the options for responding to potential coastal risks from climate change are widely understood in the general populace.

The Roadmap is a community‐driven process, and will capitalize on existing and emerging partnerships, data, information, expertise and engagement. The NOAA Roadmap project will expand capacity in Newfields to respond to climate preparedness through (1) increased knowledge about vulnerabilities of community assets (2) awareness of climate adaptation options. The NOAA Roadmap process will also help to implement community-driven actions that facilitate integrating climate adaptation strategies into their existing plans, policies and practices. It is planned to collaborate with NH CAW in this project. Following this pilot project to adapt the NOAA Roadmap for a small NH coastal watershed community, the NH Natural Resources Outreach Coalition (NROC) and the NH Coastal Adaptation Workgroup (CAW) will seek to transfer the process to other small NH coastal watershed communities.	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	 Ongoing Regional Or State New England New Hampshire Public Health and Safety Infrastructure Managed Ecosystems Natural Ecosystems Recreation and Tourism Economic Resources Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Translation of Climate Science for Sector/Decision-Maker Use  Collaborative Stakeholder Engagements, adaptation planning	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	Navigating from Concern to Action Using the NOAA Roadmap in New Hampshire’s Small Coastal Communities	f	t	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	t	UNH	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	t	f	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

This information will allow marsh managers to understand the potential outcomes of sea level rise and adapt their management techniques. Correlating longterm wetland sedimentation rates to current wetland elevation will enable a detailed analysis of the potential sedimentation deficits that exist within the impoundments, as compared to the reference wetlands.

One project will repair a dyke in a coastal impoundment and restore a tidal wetland buffer on the seaward side of the impoundment.  This project will help DFW maintain the impoundment in the short-term while enabling staff to monitor the effects of sea-level rise on the impoundment and plan longer-term management options.  The second pilot project will create an upland impoundment as an alternative for an existing coastal impoundment that might need to be abandoned if sea levels continue to rise. These projects are also part of a broader strategy to prolong the life of DFW coastal impoundments or replace their associated functions, and directly supports an America’s Great Outdoors initiative, the Delaware Bayshore Initiative.	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Planned Ongoing Climate-change Specific Projects Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Regional Or State Delaware Natural Ecosystems Biota Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	Protecting Delaware’s Coastal Impoundments from Sea Level Rise	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	t	Delaware Division of Fish and Wildlife	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.nwf.org/Global-Warming/Climate-Smart-Conservation/Adaptation-on-the-Ground/Northeast-Projects.aspx\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

This study will result in a written report that includes a summary of results, discussion of data  analysis and statistical procedures. Results can then be used to determine both the influence of a single meteorological event on sediment surface elevation and a long-term trend (i.e. decades) in elevation change, as well as make predictions for future elevation changes in our local marshes.	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Ongoing Monitoring Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic Virginia Delaware Natural Ecosystems Assess Climate and its Impacts Monitor for Climate Impacts	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	t	Delaware Sediment Elevation Tables	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	t	DNREC Delaware Coastal Programs, DNREC Watershed Assessment, US Fish and Wildlife Service (Coastal Delaware Refuge Complex), Center for the Inland Bays	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.dnrec.delaware.gov/coastal/Documents/SeaLevelRise/SLRCompSept2011.pdf	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

The primary objective of the project is to produce probabilistic risk assessments for the present, the 2050s and the 2080s, using stakeholder- defined metrics for urban watersheds. Major innovations beyond other prior studies include (a) the use of a highly detailed, extensively validated ocean model to provide probabilistic, yet accurate forecasts; and (b) inclusion of rainfall and storm surge based flooding in one combined modeling system.	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	 Ongoing Research Changes in Extremes of Weather and Climate Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic New York Public Health and Safety Infrastructure Built Coast (e.g., engineered solutions for shoreline protection) Natural Ecosystems Coasts	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	Coastal Flood Risk Assessment for the Urban Northeastern Corridor, Today and with Future Sea Levels	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	\N	f	f	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	t	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

Through a series of workshops with water managers in the Connecticut River Basin, this research will establish a climate knowledge network and an information baseline of the current use of climate information and forecasting in water management decision-making. Better understanding of how managers adopt new forecast techniques and climate data will provide the feedback needed to improve forecasting and climate information.	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	 Ongoing Research Climate Impacts on Water Resources Regional Or State New England Infrastructure Fresh Water Resources	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	Collaborative Development of Climate Information for the Connecticut River Basin using Shared Vision Forecasting	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	Research paper	f	f	t	NOAA/Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessments	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	\N	f

These issues are exacerbated by changes in climate that result in an increase in the frequency and intensity of storms and an increasing rate of sea level rise. These effects are compounded by development through increasing stormwater runoff and flooding. Effective preparedness will allow coastal communities to adapt and thrive with minimal economic, social, and environmental impacts. \r\n	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	 Ongoing Regional Or State New England New Hampshire Public Health and Safety Emergency Management Infrastructure Economic Resources Changes in Extremes of Weather and Climate Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Translation of Climate Science for Sector/Decision-Maker Use  Collaborative Stakeholder Engagements Research	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	Climate Change Adaptation and Hazard Mitigation Planning in Coastal New Hampshire \r\n	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	t	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

The team has evaluated 6 Regional Climate Models that contributed to the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP). Initial work explored how well the regional climate models are able to reproduce historical mean climate and climate extremes in the Northeast, when receiving the best available historical data at the model boundaries. Next the team assessed regional climate model performance over the historical period when driven by global climate models. Finally, projected changes in mean climate and extremes for the middle of the 21st century under the A2 emissions scenario were explored.	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	 Ongoing Research Changes in Extremes of Weather and Climate Regional Or State Public Health and Safety Emergency Management Infrastructure	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	Climate variability and change as simulated over the Northeast	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	t	NOAA/Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessments	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	t	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

We will also develop vulnerability indicators for the cities of interest and test whether mortality impacts vary in association with these indicators.

Thus, in the context of CCRUN, the heath team will perform interviews with key stakeholders in each city in order to characterize the type of triggers used to issue a warning, participating agencies, as well as and the interventions implemented as a part of the heat response strategy. In this process, we will also communicate the findings from our research to stakeholders and develop tools that may be used by stakeholders involved in the response to extreme heat.	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Ongoing Research Changes in Extremes of Weather and Climate Regional Or State Public Health and Safety Heat Related Emergency Management Assess Climate and its Impacts Social Impacts (Health and Public Security) Scenario Planning	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	Reducing Mortality from Heat Waves in the Urban Northeast	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	t	NOAA/Integrated Sciences and Assessments	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	t	t	f	\N	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f
