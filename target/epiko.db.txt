The report is a detailed assessment of climate change for coastal New Hampshire that describes how the region's climate has changed over the past century, and how climate may change over the course of this century based on different global greenhouse gas emission scenarios. The impacts of our changing climate are already affecting coastal communities. This report provides decision-relevant information on a regional scale to individual, municipal, regional, and state decision-makers.  The information compiled in the climate assessment provides the foundation for developing local adaptation plans to a changing climate and this project will disseminate this information to seacoast municipalities. Adaptation can help reduce the vulnerability of both natural and social systems to climate change and variability, and can assist with preparing for and coping with negative impacts. Adapting to a changing climate requires both data and information at a spatial and temporal scale that is relevant to decision making. The information compiled in this climate change assessment report, combined with the NHCAW training programs, will provide the foundation for developing local adaptation planning to a changing climate.\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Completed Regional Or State New England New Hampshire Climate Impacts on Water Resources Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Translation of Climate Science for Sector/Decision-Maker Use  Physical Atmospheric Coastal and Oceanic Terrestrial (Groundwater, Soil Moisture, surface water, glaciers and ice caps, land cover, biomass) Climate Society Interactions Plans, Assessments, Studies Impact Study Risk and Vulnerability	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	Assessment of Climate Change in Coastal New Hampshire	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	Provide decision-relevant information on a regional scale to individual, municipal, regional, and state decision-makers information to assist in adaptation efforts.

The Division also used the SLAMM results to look at where future nesting areas might be located and whether there was development nearby or if they could be protected.  SLAMM predicts a decrease of sandy areas with sea-level rise, but one conculsion is that Poplar Island restoration has resulted in an increase in terrapin sandy beach habitat. Thus, this shows that if the Division can stay out ahead of sea-level rise they might be able to restore or create terrapin habitat than will not be affected by sea-level rise.   	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	 Completed Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic Marlyland Natural Ecosystems Inland Habitats and Watersheds  Beaches Biota Marine Terrestrial Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Ecological and Biological	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	Terrapin Nesting Habitat and Sea-Level Rise	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Maryland Division of Wildlife and Heritage	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

The objective is to identify and map high priority, currently upland areas suitable for salt marsh migration and reestablishment. The strategy will also identify opportunities to increase resilience to sea level rise and slow the rate of loss to open water of current ecologically valuable marshes. Both the Assessment and Strategy will be developed based on a synthesis of available information and will result in implementation activities to both protect priority lands in the county as well as engage in restoration and management activities to conserve marshes. Economic considerations regarding use of the landscape for conservation, recreation, agriculture, forestry and development will be factored in to the best of our ability. The strategic plan will be used to plan to use the strategic Assessment to: Identify appropriate land protection and management strategies for facilitating salt marsh migration as sea levels rise; Identify the most suitable locations in the project area for designation as marsh migration corridors where management should focus on providing the greatest possible contiguous extent of salt marsh through the 21st century under a 1.03m sea level rise scenario; Identify priority land parcels that should be conserved for potential marsh migration corridors; Recommend best management practices (BMPs) for facilitating salt marsh establishment on newly tidal lands and prioritize locations to apply BMPs to create new high marsh habitat for threatened salt marsh birds;\r\nRecommend which potential barriers to marsh migration should be removed or mitigated. Develop policies for barrier removal/mitigation and for preventing the creation of new barriers, e.g., physical defenses against sea level rise; and Identify strategies and/or areas for marsh restoration and management, including evaluating the feasibility of restoring marshes through adding sediment, and determining BMPs and locations for improving existing marsh habitat for salt marsh birds."	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	 Ongoing Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic Marlyland Forests Coasts Inland Habitats and Watersheds  Wetlands (e.g., saltwater, brackish, freshwater; tidal/non-tidal) Natural Ecosystems Managed Ecosystems Biota Assess Climate and its Impacts Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Improve Scientific Understanding of the Climate System and Essential Climate Variables Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	Maryland Backwater Inland	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	t	f	Maryland Audubon and The Conservation Fund\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f

The report focuses specifically on sea-level rise and coastal storms. The Phase I Strategy is a key component of the Maryland Climate Action Plan, detailing the actions necessary to protect Maryland's future economic well-being, environmental heritage and public safety in the face of climate change and sea level rise. This report lays out the specific priority policy recommendations of the ARWG to address short-and long-term adaptation and response measures, planning and policy integration, education and outreach, performance measurement, and, where necessary, new legislation and/or modifications to existing laws.

Knowing this relationship will help predict when    flooding and splash-over events (such as beach erosion) might occur based on forecast water level (tide height) and wave height data. Working with the National Weather Service in Gray, Maine, NERACOOS and modelers in the Northeast region, a working prototype was developed using a water level model (NECOFS/FVCOM) and wave model (Wave Watch 3). This prototype is currently working for Hampton, New Hampshire and Scituate, Massachusetts locations. We hope to expand to other regions depending on need. For more information on how to read the nomogram, click here. This product could be used by emergency managers, coastal homeowners and other users with interest and concern about beach erosion from large-wave storms. During the Patriot's Day Storm, there were four high-tide cycles in which the water level was near or above flood stage and the waves were greater than 20' in height. This combination caused the tremendous amounts of coastal damage seen during the storm. The Coastal Flooding and Erosion Forecast System actually predicted days in advance of the Patriot's Day Storm that there was a high likelihood of this damage occurring. This capacity is extremely important to coastal property owners and emergency responders, resulting in dollars and lives saved. 	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Completed Regional Or State New England New Hampshire Public Health and Safety Emergency Management Infrastructure Climate Impacts on Water Resources Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Coastal and Oceanic Physical Forecasts and outlooks (monthly to annual, models)  Risk and Vulnerability	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	Coastal Flooding and Erosion Forecast\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	Develop a working prototype that demonstrates the empirical relationship exists between storm tide, waves and coastal flooding or splash-over damage to help predict when    flooding and splash-over events (such as beach erosion) might occur.	f	f	f	f	f	Piscataqua Region Estuary Partnership (PREP)	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	\N	f

In addition, they used Manomet's (Hector Galbraith's) non-coastal habitat vulnerability assessment model for its ecolofical communities. Both processes and results were peer-reviewed.  For the coastal species and habitats, Heritage is assessing Tier 1 and Tier 2 sites in the Action Plan and looking at where the sites fall in terms of a range of sea-level rise scenarios (0-2, 2-5. 5-10 feet).  This helps determine which sites and species located there might be influenced by sea-level rise. This information will be used in the update of the Wildlife Action Plan due to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 2015; however, the approach taken to integrate this information has not yet been determined.  	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Ongoing Completed Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic Marlyland Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Natural Ecosystems Biota Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Translation of Climate Science for Sector/Decision-Maker Use 	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	Maryland State Wildlife Action Plan Update	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	t	f	Maryland DNR Division of Wildlife and Heritage	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

Sea level has risen approximately one foot in the last century and is expected to rise another 2 - 3 feet by the year 2100. Sea level rise impacts coastal areas by exacerbating coastal flooding, influencing shoreline erosion, and submerging tidal wetlands and other low-lying lands. Such impacts pose a significant threat to the steep cliffs, wetlands and marshes, tidal estuaries, and sandy beaches, and barrier islands that comprise Maryland's coastal environment. Recognizing the need to begin planning for sea level rise, a NOAA Coastal Management Fellow with Maryland's Coastal Program developed a Sea Level Rise Response Strategy for the State of Maryland. The strategy sets forth the policy and implementation framework for reducing the State's overall vulnerability to sea level rise in the coming years.	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Completed Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic Marlyland Natural Ecosystems Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Improve Scientific Understanding of the Climate System and Essential Climate Variables Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Translate Climate Science for the Public  Promote Public Climate Literacy Hindcasts (climatologies, models) Forecasts and outlooks (monthly to annual, models)  Plans, Assessments, Studies Adaptation/Action Plan Adaptation/Action Plan Risk and Vulnerability Engagement Management Guidance (i.e. structured decision making) Regulatory/ Policy Guidance	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	A Sea Level Rise Response Strategy for the State of Maryland	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Maryland Department of Natural Resources 	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.dnr.state.md.us/bay/czm/sea_level_rise.html	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

The CVI ranks the following in terms of their physical \r\ncontribution to sea-level rise-related coastal change: geomorphology, regional coastal slope, rate of relative sea-level rise, shoreline change rates, mean tidal range and mean wave height. Rankings for each variable were combined and an index value calculated for 1-minute grid cells covering the park. The CVI highlights those regions where the physical effects of sea-level rise might be the greatest. This approach combines the coastal system's susceptibility to change with its natural ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions, yielding a quantitative, although relative, measure of the park's natural vulnerability to the effects of sea-level rise.  The CVI provides an objective technique for evaluation and long-term planning by scientists and park managers. Assateague Island consists of stable and washover dominated portions of barrier beach backed by wetland and marsh. The areas within Assateague that are likely to be most vulnerable to sea-level rise are those with the highest occurrence of overwash and the highest rates of shoreline change."	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Completed Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic Virginia Natural Ecosystems Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Forecasts of Climate Conditions Forecasts of Climate Impacts  Translation of Climate Science for Sector/Decision-Maker Use  Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Physical Coastal and Oceanic Surface (Sea-surface temperature, sea level, salinity, ocean color, wave height) Projections (intra-annual to multi-decadal, including SLR and model down-scaling) Maps (Imagery, geo-referenced data) Plans, Assessments, Studies Risk and Vulnerability	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	COASTAL VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT OF ASSATEAGUE ISLAND NATIONAL SEASHORE(ASIS) TO SEA-LEVEL RISE\r\n	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	U.S. Geological Society\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2004/1020/images/pdf/asis.pdf) \r\n	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

This project is funded with State Wildlife Grant dollars and generous support from the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation.  It is designed to address one of the Data and Modeling Needs that was identified within our 2009 climate change adaptation strategy (page 19; http://www.bewildvirginia.org/climate-change/).  The project has two main research components: \r\n1.  Develop a regional climate model that can help inform wildlife management decisions and; 2.  Assess how the predicted changes are likely to impact species and habitats associated with Virginia’s Wildlife Action Plan.                                                      For the first component, a climatologist conducted a dynamic downscaling of the continental-scale climate models developed by the IPCC.  This allowed for about 45 different climate variables and increased the geographic resolution from 100 sq. km. to 10 sq. km.  The models include almost all of West Virginia, all of Virginia, all of Maryland, and all of Delaware.  Models were generated using the B1 and the A1FI green house gas emission scenarios and outputs were generated for the year 2060 (50 years from our start date) and the year 2095 (near the end of the IPCC model run).  For the second component, the climate change data was used to determined potential range shifts of a selection of Species of Greatest Conservation Need based on the climate variables most significant to a species survival.  All outputs are spatially explicit and depict potential species shifts based solely on climate variables at 2050 and 2095.	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Ongoing Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic Virginia Natural Ecosystems Biota Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Downscale Climate Models Forecasts of Climate Impacts  Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Atmospheric Physical Surface (air temperature, precipitation, wind) Upper-air  Composition Terrestrial (Groundwater, Soil Moisture, surface water, glaciers and ice caps, land cover, biomass) Ecological and Biological In situ Observations Other Plans, Assessments, Studies Risk and Vulnerability, research	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	Vulnerability Assessment of Virginia's Species of Greatest Conservation Need\r\n	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	t	f	Department of Game and Inland Fisheries, National Wildlife Federation, Conservation Management Institute 	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	\N	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

This tool consists of aprogrammed in a Microsoft Excel workbook; uses downscaled climate predictions provided by the Climate Wizard; requires knowledge about current distribution and natural history of the species being assessed; predicts whether a species will decline, remain stable, or increase in numbers or distribution within an assessment area; identifies key factors associated with vulnerability for assessed species; and is complementary to NatureServe Conservation Status Ranks (assessment factors do not overlap). The Index uses a scoring system that integrates a species’ predicted exposure to climate change within an assessment area and three sets of factors associated with climate change sensitivity, each supported by published studies: 1) indirect exposure to climate change, 2) species specific factors (including dispersal ability, temperature and precipitation sensitivity, physical habitat specificity, interspecific interactions, and genetic factors), and 3) documented response to climate change.	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Completed Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic Virginia Biota Marine Endangered, Threatened, or Protected Species Terrestrial Candidate Species Species of Concern Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Risk Assessments Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Plans, Assessments, Studies Risk and Vulnerability	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	Applying the NatureServe Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment to Natural Heritage Resources in Virginia	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation – Division of Natural Heritage	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

The product of this working group—The Yale Framework—assists conservation planners in selecting the assessment and modeling strategies that are most relevant to their specific needs. Rather than supplanting existing techniques, the Yale Framework provides simplified and flexible advice on models and data, and presents a list of commonly used datasets that can be helpful to planners. The Framework also provides a structured menu of options that assist resource managers in determining the best possible approach to conservation, as opposed to offering a prescriptive approach to natural resource management. The Yale Mapping Framework has been built using the Data Basin platform. Data Basin makes it simple to find reliable data and make compelling visualizations. Planners can locate datasets, combine multiple layers together in a visualization session, and then share maps with their colleagues. With the Data Basin data and tools, planners have everything they need to make their assessments.\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Ongoing National Natural Ecosystems Biota Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Translation of Climate Science for Sector/Decision-Maker Use  Evaluation of Climate Change Tools and Data Training and Capacity Building Data Support tools (help using specific data products) Adaptation and Mitigation Guidance, including Best Practices Manuals, Toolkits, and Guides Viewers and Web-based Tools Monitoring tools (e.g. U.S. Drought Monitor) Visualization tools (web-based, mapping programs) Prioritization Tools Management Guidance (i.e. structured decision making)	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	The Yale Mapping Framework for Integrating Climate Adaptatin and Landscape Conservation Planning\r\n	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	t	f	Yale University, School of Forestry & Environmental Studies\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	http://www.databasin.org/yale\r\n	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

This assessment provided a pilot to support a larger project focused on developing a handbook for integrating Climate Change Adaptation into CCP revisions at National Wildlife Refuges.  In this assessment, potential implications of salt- water inundation and habitat loss from SLR and increased storm surge elevations, as well as change in ecosystem/habitat composition due to changes in land use and land cover (i.e. conversion from natural conditions) were modeled to estimate responses by priority resources.  Focus was placed on biological and infrastructure resources of critical importance.  Biological resources included rare species populations and mapped habitat of known importance for migratory bird species and monarch butterflies, while infrastructure resources included structures and infrastructure necessary for the recreational and educational missions of the Refuge Complex (e.g. kiosks, roadways, visitor center).  Spatial input data were most accessible and accurate for the Refuge Complex proper, and modeling outputs were most informative there as well.  However, the study area included the entirety of the Virginia Eastern Shore (i.e. supporting landscape).  Using NatureServe Vista, an ArcGIS extension Decision Support Tool, scenarios were modeled for timesteps of 2025, 2050, 2075 and 2100.  Outputs included tabular and map summaries of predicted changes in available habitat for priority biological and infrastructure resources.  	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Completed Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic Virginia Infrastructure Managed Ecosystems Natural Ecosystems Biota Social and Cultural Resources Recreation and Tourism Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Plans, Assessments, Studies Risk and Vulnerability	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	ESVaNWR Resource Vulnerability Assessment: RESOURCE VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT AND STRATEGIES FOR MANAGEMENT OPTIONS FOR THE EASTERN SHORE OF VIRGINIA AND FISHERMAN ISLAND NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGES\r\n	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation – Division of Natural Heritage and NatureServe\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	t	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

The ultimate goal of the project is to have definitive actions that result in coastal communities being more resilient to climate variability. In Maine this included a survey and focus groups of property owners, municipal officials, and recreationists to determine "barriers and benefits that coastal property owners and municipal officials face in taking action to prepare for impacts from coastal storms, flooding, and erosion." This report summarizes the results of this project and the surveys and focus groups.

To generate future projections for Portland, Farmington, and Lewiston, simulated temperature and precipitation from four climate models were fitted to local, long-term weather observations.  Two future scenarios were used for estimated carbon emissions. For the  lower emissions scenario, conservation practices and development of renewable energy reduce emissions below those of today by 2100. In the higher \r\nemissions scenario, fossil fuels are assumed to remain a primary energy resource, and emissions grow four times the amount of today by 2100.  The scenarios describe climate in terms of temperature and precipitation for three future periods: the  near-term, 2010-2039, mid-century, 2040-2069, and end-of-century, 2070-2099.

Discussions have begun on how to reduce and eventually eliminate the rapid and accelerating additions of carbon dioxide, other greenhouse gases, and other pollutants to the world’s atmosphere and oceans. These efforts are vitally important and urgent for Maine and the rest of the world.  This report considers past change over geologic time, recent evidence of accelerated rates of change, and the implications of continued climate change in Maine during the 21st century as a result of greenhouse gas emissions and their associated pollutants. Even if a coordinated response succeeds in eliminating excess greenhouse gas emissions by the end of the century, something that appears highly unlikely today, climate change will continue because the elevated levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) can persist in the atmosphere for thousands of years to come.

The authors project future sea level rise based on historical measurements and global scenarios, and apply them to digital elevation models to demonstrate the vulnerability of New Jersey's coast.  The authors estimate that 1 to 3 % of New Jersey’s land area will be  affected by inundation and 6.5 to over 9 % by episodic coastal flooding over the next century.  Possible impacts to natural systems and socioeconomic impacts are also summarized.  A range of adaptation and mitigation options for the coastal area are also outlines.  The report suggests that where possible a gradual withdrawal of development from some areas of the New Jersey coast may be the optimum management strategy for protecting natural ecosystems. \r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Completed Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic New Jersey Infrastructure Managed Ecosystems Natural Ecosystems Biota Social and Cultural Resources Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Improve Scientific Understanding of the Climate System and Essential Climate Variables Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Forecasts of Climate Impacts  Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Coastal and Oceanic Surface (Sea-surface temperature, sea level, salinity, ocean color, wave height) Sub-surface (e.g., temperature, salinity, nutrients, carbon, phytoplankton) Maps (Imagery, geo-referenced data) Plans, Assessments, Studies Adaptation/Action Plan Risk and Vulnerability	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	FUTURE SEA LEVEL RISE AND THE NEW JERSEY COAST Assessing Potential Impacts and Opportunities\r\n	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs Princeton University\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://cdn.publicinterestnetwork.org/assets/sR9N-sL9cXyA7pGI_ODVlw/Future_Sea_Level_Rise.pdf\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

This study was part of a broader assessment of New Jersey’s coastal environmental resources conducted by the Walton Center for Remote Sensing & Spatial Analysis (CRSSA) of Rutgers University and the American Littoral Society.  This report expands on Cooper et al., 2005.  "The primary objectives of this work is to examine six specific issues related to coastal vulnerability and future adaptability: to map near shore development; to map the land use/land cover that is vulnerable to tidal surge inundation and flooding; to map the distance from coastal waters to the first developed obstruction (i.e. how far removed is existing development from the surging coastal waters); to map the degree of shoreline alteration due to coastal protection structures; to map where coastal beach and dune habitats are relatively undisturbed; and delineate those portions of our coastal wetland complex that are free to retreat inland as part of the natural landward migration process (i.e., where are coastal wetlands bordered by undeveloped vs. developed uplands).

CRSSA is responsible for the technical aspects, while JC NERR is responsible for the collaborative, evaluation/assessment and knowledge dissemination portions of the project.  In summary, the proposed project has three main outcomes: 1) serve as a demonstration project as to the feasibility and utility of enhanced GIS/LiDAR-based assessment of coastal infrastructure and habitat vulnerability to sea level rise; and 2) develop a suite internet-accessible geospatial and database visualization and analysis tools that will facilitate the dissemination of this information; and 3) promote enhanced preparedness and land use planning decisions in the face of continued sea level rise. The first step in this project is to conduct a needs assessment of our intended users to (1) identify their current level and source of information regarding sea level rise and climate change impacts to New Jersey’s bay and ocean front , (2) identify parameters that are most important to their decision-making (http://www.jcnerr.org/Needs%20Assessment%20Final%20report.pdf), (3) determine their level of comfort with online mapping and decision support tools (http://www.jcnerr.org/Usability%20Testing.final%20report.pdf), (4) determine the best structure for querying and interacting with the CV10 DSS, (5) determine what would enable or prevent them from using such a product. \r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Ongoing Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic New Jersey Infrastructure Managed Ecosystems Natural Ecosystems Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Risk Assessments Forecasts of Climate Conditions Forecasts of Climate Impacts  Coastal and Oceanic Surface (Sea-surface temperature, sea level, salinity, ocean color, wave height) Forecasts and outlooks (monthly to annual, models)  Projections (intra-annual to multi-decadal, including SLR and model down-scaling) Maps (Imagery, geo-referenced data) Risk and Vulnerability Viewers and Web-based Tools Visualization tools (web-based, mapping programs)	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	Place-based Decision Support System to Assess Vulnerability of New Jersey’s Coast to Sea Level Rise\r\n	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	t	f	Jacques Cousteau National Estuarine Research Reserve\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://ciceet.unh.edu/progressreports/2010/9_2010/lathrop09/index.html\r\n	f	f	t	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

THe CCVAP  is a GIS-based tool that was developed to help land use planners, hazard mitigation planners, emergency managers, and other local decision-makers to identify vulnerability to coastal hazards and sea-level rise at the community level.   The CCVAP oultines the needed steps to identify  vulnerable land areas under present and future inundation scenarios geospatially.  Using these inundation scenarios (0.5 meters, 1.0 meters, and 1.5 meters), coastal decision-makers  now have a greater ability determine the potential inundation threats to  built infrastructure, sensitive natural resources, and special needs populations.  The resilience asseessment is a facilitated questionnaire.  It is a non-regulatory tool that is meant to help local decision-makers collaboratively  identify planning, mitigation, and adaptation opportunities to reduce vulnerability to coastal storms and sea level rise, building  capacity for coastal community resilience.  It is provides a starting point for a dialogue among various decision-makers, helping to spawn creative thinking and collaboration on ways to become more resilient for existing and future generations.  The questionnaire highlights the importance of local plan integration and consistency with municipal building codes and ordinances, and it identifies the importance of localized hazard assessments and the need to link them to planning, outreach, mitigation, response, and recovery. The report also discusses the Coastal Vulnerability Index.	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Completed Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic New Jersey Infrastructure Managed Ecosystems Natural Ecosystems Biota Social and Cultural Resources Economic Resources Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Physical Coastal and Oceanic Surface (Sea-surface temperature, sea level, salinity, ocean color, wave height) Forecasts and outlooks (monthly to annual, models)  Projections (intra-annual to multi-decadal, including SLR and model down-scaling) Plans, Assessments, Studies Maps (Imagery, geo-referenced data) Risk and Vulnerability Viewers and Web-based Tools Visualization tools (web-based, mapping programs)	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, Coastal Management Office\r\n	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Dorina Frizzera, NJ DEP,   (609) 777-3251 or dorina.frizzera@dep.state.nj.us\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.nj.gov/dep/cmp/docs/ccvap-greenwich.pdf\r\n	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

This informaiton can assist a community in understanding where hazards may be more likely to occur.   To help determine where high hazard areas are within a community or the coastal zone , the New Jersey Coastal Management Office developed a geospatial, composite overlay model or a coastal vulnerability index.  The model includes six  geospatial inputs, including  storm surge inundation scenarios, low slopes, flood prone areas, poorly drained soils, erosion prone areas, and geomorphology.  By incorporating sea level rise scenarios into storm \r\nsurge models, the Coastal Management Office could visually demonstrate how climate \r\nchange may shift high hazard areas further inland overtime.  This coastal vulnerability assessmnet may be useful in identifying locations for the investment of mitigation assistance.  It may also identify where engineering and adaptation actions to address climate change may be extremely difficult or ineffective.

Sea level rise is a significant and growing threat to the coastal region of New Jersey, USA and this study presents a comprehensive assessment of the expected impacts.  We project future \r\nsea level rise based on historical measurements and global scenarios, and apply them to digital elevation models to illustrate the extent to which the New Jersey coast is vulnerable.  We estimate that 1 to 3 % of New Jersey’s land area will be affected by inundation and 6.5 to over 9 % by episodic coastal flooding over the next century.  We also characterize potential impacts on \r\nthe socioeconomic and natural systems of the New Jersey coast focusing on Cape May Point for illustrative purposes.  We then suggest a range of potential adaptation and mitigation opportunities for managing coastal areas in response to sea level rise.  Our findings suggest that where possible a gradual withdrawal of development from some areas of the New Jersey coast may be the optimum management strategy for protecting natural ecosystems.	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	 Completed Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic New Jersey Infrastructure Managed Ecosystems Natural Ecosystems Social and Cultural Resources Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Forecasts of Climate Conditions Forecasts and outlooks (monthly to annual, models)  Projections (intra-annual to multi-decadal, including SLR and model down-scaling) Maps (Imagery, geo-referenced data) Plans, Assessments, Studies Risk and Vulnerability	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	FUTURE SEA LEVEL RISE AND THE NEW JERSEY COAST Assessing Potential Impacts and Opportunities \r\n	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	Princeton University\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	\N	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	http://www.princeton.edu/step/people/faculty/michael-oppenheimer/recent-publications/Future-Sea-Level-Rise-and-the-New-Jersey-Coast-Assessing-Potential-Impacts-and-Opportunities.pdf\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

In addition, they used Manomet's (Hector Galbraith's) non-coastal habitat vulnerability assessment model for its ecolofical communities. Both processes and results were peer-reviewed.  For the coastal species and habitats, Heritage is assessing Tier 1 and Tier 2 sites in the Action Plan and looking at where the sites fall in terms of a range of sea-level rise scenarios (0-2, 2-5. 5-10 feet).  This helps determine which sites and species located there might be influenced by sea-level rise. This information will be used in the update of the Wildlife Action Plan due to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 2015; however, the approach taken to integrate this information has not yet been determined.  \r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Ongoing Completed Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic Marlyland Natural Ecosystems Estuaries Biota Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Evaluation of Climate Change Tools and Data Social Impacts (Health and Public Security), Projects “retrofitted” for climate change, Adaptation/ Climate-Smart Planning	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	Maryland State Wildlife Action Plan Update	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	t	Maryland DNR Division of Wildlife and Heritage	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f

The objective is to identify and map high priority, currently upland areas suitable for salt marsh migration and reestablishment. The strategy will also identify opportunities to increase resilience to sea level rise and slow the rate of loss to open water of current ecologically valuable marshes. Both the Assessment and Strategy will be developed based on a synthesis of available information and will result in implementation activities to both protect priority lands in the county as well as engage in restoration and management activities to conserve marshes. Economic considerations regarding use of the landscape for conservation, recreation, agriculture, forestry and development will be factored in to the best of our ability. The strategic plan will be used to plan to use the strategic Assessment to: Identify appropriate land protection and management strategies for facilitating salt marsh migration as sea levels rise; Identify the most suitable locations in the project area for designation as marsh migration corridors where management should focus on providing the greatest possible contiguous extent of salt marsh through the 21st century under a 1.03m sea level rise scenario; Identify priority land parcels that should be conserved for potential marsh migration corridors; Recommend best management practices (BMPs) for facilitating salt marsh establishment on newly tidal lands and prioritize locations to apply BMPs to create new high marsh habitat for threatened salt marsh birds;\r\nRecommend which potential barriers to marsh migration should be removed or mitigated. Develop policies for barrier removal/mitigation and for preventing the creation of new barriers, e.g., physical defenses against sea level rise; and Identify strategies and/or areas for marsh restoration and management, including evaluating the feasibility of restoring marshes through adding sediment, and determining BMPs and locations for improving existing marsh habitat for salt marsh birds."	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	 Ongoing Regional Or State Mid-Atlantic Marlyland Natural Ecosystems Coasts Estuaries Wetlands (e.g., saltwater, brackish, freshwater; tidal/non-tidal) Oceans Biota Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Conservation/ Restoration of Sensitive Species and Habitats Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Evaluation of Climate Change Tools and Data, Climate Change Specific Projects, Adaptation/ Climate-Smart Planning	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	Maryland Blackwater Inland	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	t	Maryland Audubon and The Conservation Fund\r\n	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f

This project will explore various climate change scenarios to understand the City’s future  vulnerabilities to and the consequences of climate change.  A Risk Management plan will be developed to address different climate change risks and to incorporate low and high cost responses over the short and long term. Public outreach will include use of the City’s website to publish information about climate change as well as solicit input from the public to be used as the basis for  the community process that will be part of the Master Plan update. Neither the concept of climate adaptation nor the options for responding to potential coastal risks from climate change are widely understood in the general populace. This process will enable the City to undertake focused outreach around climate adaptation, without encumbering the Master Plan process.	f	f	f	t	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	 Ongoing Regional Or State New England New Hampshire Local/City  Public Health and Safety Emergency Management Infrastructure Natural Ecosystems Coasts Economic Resources Climate Impacts on Water Resources Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Improve Scientific Understanding of the Climate System and Essential Climate Variables Assess Climate and its Impacts Vulnerability assessments (species, habitats and community vulnerability assessments) Risk Assessments Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Translation of Climate Science for Sector/Decision-Maker Use  Promote Public Climate Literacy Translate Climate Science for the Public,  Climate change- specific projects, research	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	Portsmouth Coastal Resilience Initiative	f	t	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	Objectives include:  understand the City’s future  vulnerabilities to and the consequences of climate change and enable the City to undertake focused outreach around climate adaptation, without encumbering the Master Plan process.	f	f	t	City of Portsmouth New Hampshire	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	t	\N	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	Portsmouthcoastalresilience.docx	f

The Roadmap is a community‐driven process, and will capitalize on existing and emerging partnerships, data, information, expertise and engagement. The NOAA Roadmap project will expand capacity in Newfields to respond to climate preparedness through (1) increased knowledge about vulnerabilities of community assets (2) awareness of climate adaptation options. The NOAA Roadmap process will also help to implement community-driven actions that facilitate integrating climate adaptation strategies into their existing plans, policies and practices. It is planned to collaborate with NH CAW in this project. Following this pilot project to adapt the NOAA Roadmap for a small NH coastal watershed community, the NH Natural Resources Outreach Coalition (NROC) and the NH Coastal Adaptation Workgroup (CAW) will seek to transfer the process to other small NH coastal watershed communities.	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	 Ongoing Regional Or State New England New Hampshire Public Health and Safety Infrastructure Managed Ecosystems Natural Ecosystems Recreation and Tourism Economic Resources Coasts and Climate Resilience (including sea-level rise) Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Translation of Climate Science for Sector/Decision-Maker Use  Collaborative Stakeholder Engagements, adaptation planning	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	Navigating from Concern to Action Using the NOAA Roadmap in New Hampshire’s Small Coastal Communities	f	t	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	t	UNH	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	t	f	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f
239	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	NH7	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	March 2012	f	NH coastal municipalities are confronted by a challenging set of land use and hazard management concerns that include extreme weather events, storm surges, flooding, coastal erosion, and loss of key coastal habitats. These issues are exacerbated by changes in climate that result in an increase in the frequency and intensity of storms and an increasing rate of sea level rise. These effects are compounded by development through increasing stormwater runoff and flooding. Effective preparedness will allow coastal communities to adapt and thrive with minimal economic, social, and environmental impacts. \r\n	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	 Ongoing Regional Or State New England New Hampshire Public Health and Safety Emergency Management Infrastructure Economic Resources Changes in Extremes of Weather and Climate Inform Mitigation and Adaptation Choices Translation of Climate Science for Sector/Decision-Maker Use  Collaborative Stakeholder Engagements	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	Climate Change Adaptation and Hazard Mitigation Planning in Coastal New Hampshire \r\n	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f	f	t	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	\N	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	\N	f
